Then he said, “If I were to say that it should, it would be obligatory and you would not be able to perform it,” after which he said, “Leave me alone as long as I have said nothing to you, for your predecessors perished simply on account of their much questioning and their disagreement with their prophets. But when I command you to do anything, obey it as much as you can; and when I forbid you to do anything, leave it alone.”\n\nMuslim transmitted it.</b>",

        "hadithText": "Jabir b. ‘Abdallah said: God’s messenger remained in Medina nine years, during which he had not performed the hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that God’s messenger was about to perform the hajj. Large numbers came to Medina, and we went out with him. When we reached Dhul Hulaifa, Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais, gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr and sent to God’s messenger asking what she was to do. He replied, “Bathe, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and put on the <i>ihram</i>.” God’s messenger then prayed in the mosque, and after he had mounted al-Qaswa' and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida’, he raised his voice declaring God’s unity and saying, “<i>Labbaik</i>, O God,<i> labbaik labbaik</i>; Thou hast no partner; <i>labbaik</i>; praise and grace are Thine and the dominion; Thou hast no partner.” Jabir said : We did not express our intention of performing anything but the hajj, being unaware of the <i>‘umra</i> [at that season], but when we came with him to the House he touched the corner and made seven circuits, running three of them and walking four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham, he recited, “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (Qur’an 2:125)He then prayed two <i>'rak'as</i>, having the station between him and the House. A version says that he recited in the two <i>rak'as</i>,. “Say, He is God, One,” and, “Say, O infidels.” (Qur’an 112, and 109) He then returned to the corner and touched it, after which he went out by the gate to as-Safa, on coming near to which he recited. “As-Safa and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by God,” (Qur’an 2:158) adding, “I begin with what God began with.” So he went first to as-Safa, and mounting it till he could see the House, he faced the <i>qibla</i>, declared God's unity, proclaimed His greatness, and said, “There is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent; there is no god but God alone who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates.\" He then made supplication in the course of that, saying such words three times. He next descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at as-Safa, and when he came to al-Marwa for the last time, he called out, he being on al-Marwa and the people below him, saying, “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding my religion, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an <i>'umra</i> ; so if any of you has no sacrificial animals he,may take off the <i>ihram</i> and treat it as an <i>‘umra</i>. Suraqa b. Malik b.Jush'um then got up and asked, “Messenger of God, does this apply to the present year, or does it apply for ever?\" God’s messenger intertwined his fingers and said twice, “The <i>‘umra</i> has become incorporated in the <i>hajj</i>,\" adding “No, but for ever and ever.\" ‘Ali came from the Yemen with the Prophet’s sacrificial animals and he asked him what he had said when he undertook the duty of performing the <i>hajj</i>. He replied that he had said, “0 God, I am putting on the <i>ihram</i> for the same purpose as Thy messenger has put it on.\" He said, “I have with me the sacrificial animals, so do not put off the <i>ihram</i>.” [Jabir] said: The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet was a hundred. Then all the people, except the Prophet and those who had with them sacrificial animals, removed the <i>ihram</i> and clipped their hair. When yaum at-tarwiya (The 8th of Dhul Hijja, the day when pilgrims leave Mecca and go to Mina. The name is commonly explained as meaning that this was the day when the pilgrims provided themselves with a supply of water for the arid journey before them) came they went towards Mina having put on the <i>ihram</i> for the <i>hajj</i>, and the Prophet rode and prayed there the noon, afternoon, sunset, evening and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose, and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up for him at Namira (A place or a hill near ‘Arafa). God’s messenger then set out, and Quraish did not doubt that he would observe a halt at the sacred site (At al-Muzdalifa, al-Mash'ar al-haram, a hill sacred to the god Ouzah in pre-lslamic times), as Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period ; but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafa and found that the tent had been set up for him at Namira. There he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered al- Qaswa’ to be brought, and when it was saddled for him he went down into the valley and addressed the people, saying, “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Everything pertaining to the pre-Islamic period has been put under my feet, and claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-lslamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood-vengeance I remit is the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith (Rabi’a was a grandson of 'Abd al-Muttalib. The name of the child who had been killed is variously given as Adam, Tammam and Iyas. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr says Adam is a mistake, but does not commit himself to either of the other two names) who was suckled among the B. Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Show fear towards God regarding women, for you have got them under God’s security, and have the right to intercourse with them by God's word. They must not bring into your houses anyone whom you dislike, but if they do that beat them, though not severely. You are responsible for providing them with their food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, i.e. God’s Book, by which, if you hold to it, you will never again go astray. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?\" They replied, “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. ” Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said, “O God, be witness ; O God, be witness,” saying it three times. Bilal then uttered the call to prayer, and the <i>iqama</i>, and he prayed the noon prayer; he then uttered the <i>iqama</i> and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted his camel and came to the place of standing, making his she-camel al-Qaswa’ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot (The Arabic is <i>Habl al-mushat</i>, which is variously explained as above, or as ‘the concourse of horse on foot', or as the name of a place.) in front of him. He faced the <i>qibla</i> and remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usama up behind him and went quickly till he came to al-Muzdalifa, where he prayed the sunset and the evening prayer with one <i>adhan</i> and two <i>iqama</i>s without saying ‘Glory be to God' between them. He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer with an <i>adhan</i> and an <i>iqama</i> when the morning light was clear. He then mounted al-Qaswa’ and when he came to the sacred site he faced the <i>qibla</i>, supplicated God, declared His greatness, His uniqueness and His unity, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, taking al-Fadl b. ‘Abbas behind him, and came to the valley of Muhassir (Between al-Muzdalifa and Mini). He urged the camel a little and following the middle road which comes out at the greatest <i>jamra</i> (<i>Jamra</i>, originally a pebble, is applied to a heap of stones, of which there are three in the valley of Mina. One of the rites of the <i>hajj</i> is to throw small stones at them), he came to the <i>jamra</i> which is beside the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles (Literally, 'pebbles that are thrown’: used to indicate small pebbles about the size of a date-stone), saying “God is most great” each time he threw a pebble. He threw them from the bottom of the valley, then went to the place of sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three victims with his own hand. Then he gave some to ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder, and he shared with him in his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each victim should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Then God’s messenger mounted, and going quickly to the House, prayed the noon prayer in Mecca. He came to the B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said, “Draw water, B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib. Were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you.” So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it. \n\nMuslim transmitted it.</b>",

He first raised his voice in the <i>talbiya</i> for the <i>‘umra</i> and afterwards he did so for the <i>hajj</i>, and the people along with the Prophet did it first for the <i>‘umra</i> and afterwards for the <i>hajj</i>.

Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during the <i>hajj</i> and seven days when they return to their families.” He performed the circumambulation when he came to Mecca, first touching the corner (The corner of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then running during three circuits and walking during four, and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House he prayed two rak'as at the Station (Maqam Ibrahim), then giving the salutation, and departing, he went to as-Safa and went seven times between as-Safa and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his <i>hajj</i>, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, gone quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House, after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him.

As it was only five days before they were due at ‘Arafa, they said he had ordered them to go in to their wives and so they would come to ‘Arafa with their penises dripping with prostatic fluid. He said that Jabir made a gesture, moving his hand, and he could still imagine himself looking at him (Perhaps the gesture was meant to indicate that they could have shaken off the fluid). The Prophet then got up among them and said, “You know that I am the most godfearing, truthful and pious one among you. Were it not that I have sacrificial animals I would have removed the ihram as you are doing, and had I known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later I would not have brought sacrificial animals ; so remove the <i>ihram</i>.'’ They did so, hearing and obeying. ‘Ata’ quoted Jabir as saying that ‘Ali arrived after his expedition to collect the poor rate and he asked him for what he had raised his voice in the <i>talbiya</i>. He replied that he had done it for the same purpose as the Prophet, so God's messenger said to him, “Bring the sacrificial animals and remain in the sacred state.” He said that ‘Ali brought sacrificial animals for him and that Suraqa b.

It is said that this name was applied to them because they boasted of their bravery and endurance. Another explanation is that they observed rites of standing only at <i>Hamss'</i>, which is the Ka’ba) but the rest of the Arabs used to stand at ‘Arafa ; then when Islam came God most high commanded His Prophet to go to ‘Arafat (Both 'Arafa and its plural‘Arafat are used. It is rather peculiar to find bcth used In the same tradition) and stand there, then go quickly from it. That is in accordance with the words of Him who is great and glorious, “Then go quickly from where the people went quickly.”(Qur’an, 2, 199)\n\nBukhari and Muslim.</b>",

So he repeated the supplication at al-Muzdalifa in the morning and was given an answer to what he asked, whereupon he laughed (or he said that he smiled). Abu Bakr and ‘Umar then said to him, “You for whom we would give our fathers and mothers as ransom, what has made you laugh, for this is not a time at which you have been accustomed to laugh ? May God give you cause for laughter all your life !” He replied, “When God’s enemy, Iblls, knew that God who is great and glorious had answered my supplication and forgiven my people, he took some earth and began to throw it on his head crying out ‘Woe and destruction.’ The sight of his distress made me laugh.”\n\nIbn Majah transmitted it, and Baihaqi transmitted something similar in Kitab al-ba‘th wan-nushur.</b>",

Dhul Qa'da, Dhul Hijja. and Muharram, and also Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha'ban.”( The month Rajab is here connected with the North Arabian tribe of Mudar because they are said to have honoured it greatly and never to have broken its sacred nature. The precise reference to its place among the months is said’to be for the purpose of removing any doubt about it owing to the earlier practice of periodically intercalating a month) He asked, “What month is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not Dhul Hijja?\" and they replied that it was. He asked, “What town is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His apostle knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not al-Balda?”( This word occurs a number of times in the Qur’an in the general sense of a district, but in 27, 91 it is used particularly of Mecca which is there called “this district (balda)\". In the tradition the word seems to be used as if it were a proper name) and they replied that it was.

He said, “Your lives, property and honour must be regarded by you with a sacredness like that of this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. O, do not revert after my death to being people who are astray, beheading one another. Have I delivered the message ?\" When they replied that he had he said, “O God, testify ; and let him who is present convey it to him who is absent, for many a one to whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than the one who hears.” \n\nBukhari and Muslim.</b>",
