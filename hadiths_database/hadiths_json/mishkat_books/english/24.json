Jundub said: When the Prophet prayed he turned his face to us and asked, “Who among you had a vision last night?” If one of us had had one he told it and he would interpret it as God willed. One day he asked us, “Has any of you had a vision?” and when we replied that we had not he said:\n“But last night I saw two men who came to me, took me by the hand and brought me out to a holy land. I saw a man sitting and a man standing with a hooked piece of iron in his hand which he was inserting into the other man's jaw and cleaving it till it reached the back of his neck, and doing the same with the other jaw. This jaw was recovering, and then he would do the same again. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a man who was lying on his back over whom a man was standing with a stone the size of his hand, or a rock, with which he was pounding his head. When he struck him the stone rolled away and he went after it to get it, and did not return to this man till his head was healed and restored to its former condition. He then went back to him and struck him. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a hole like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, under which there was a fire. It contained naked men and women who when the fire rose mounted till they almost came out, but who returned into it when it subsided. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a river of blood in the middle of which a man was standing and on the bank of which there was a man with some stones in front of him. The man who was in the river came forward and when he wanted to come out the other threw a stone into his mouth and sent him back where he came from; and as often as he tried to come out he threw a stone into his mouth and he returned to where he came from. I asked what this was and they\" told me to come away. So we went on till we reached a green garden containing a huge tree at the foot of which were an old man and some boys and near which there was a man in front of whom there was a fire which he was kindling. My two companions took me up the tree and brought me into a house in the middle of the tree more beautiful than any I had seen in which were old men, youths, women and boys. They then took me out of it and brought me up the tree and took me into a more beautiful and more excellent house in which were old men and youths. Telling them that they had taken me round this night, I asked them to inform me about what I had seen, to which they agreed. \nThey said that the man I had seen having his jaw cloven was a liar who told lies which were reported from him and carried to the ends of the earth, so what I had seen would be done to him till the day of resurrection. The man whose head I had seen being pounded was a man whom God had taught the Qur’an but who had slept at night and neglected it and had not acted according to its teachings in the daytime, so what I had seen would be done to him till the day of resurrection. Those I had seen in the hole were fornicators and the one I had seen in the river was the one who devoured usury. The old man I had seen at the foot of the tree was Abraham, the boys around him were the children of men, and the one who was kindling the fire was Malik the guardian of hell. The first house I entered was the abode of the generality of believers, but this house was the abode of the martyrs. One of them informing me that he was Gabriel and that the other was Michael told me to raise my head, and when I did so I saw something like a white cloud (a version giving cumulus cloud) and they told me that would be my abode. I asked them to let me enter my dwelling, but they told me I had still some time to live which I had not completed and that if I had completed it I would have entered my dwelling.” \n\nBukhari transmitted it.</b>",

        "hadithText": "Samura b. Jundub told that one of the things God’s messenger often asked his companions was, “Has any of you had a vision?” Then anyone whom God wished to do so would tell him. One morning he said to them, “Two people came to me last night and rousing me told me to set out, so I set out along with them.” \nHe mentioned at length something similar to the tradition mentioned in the first section, but it contains this addition which is not in the aforementioned tradition:\n“We came to a luxuriant garden containing all kinds of Spring blossom in the middle of which there was a man who was so tall that I could scarcely see his head, so high it went up into the sky; and around the man there were more children than I had ever seen. I asked my companions who this was and who these were, but they told me to come away. So we went on and came to a huge garden than which I had never seen any larger or more beautiful. They told me to go up into it, and when we had done so we came to a city built of gold and silver bricks. When we came to the gate of the city we asked that it should be opened, and when that was done and we had entered we were met by men half of whose frame was like the most beautiful you could see while the other half was like the most ugly you could see. There was a river opposite flowing with water as white as pure milk, and my companions told them to go and plunge into that river. They did so and returned to us having had that ugliness removed from them and having become most beautiful in appearance.\" \nIn the exposition of this addition he mentioned, “The tall man who was in the garden was Abraham and the children who were around him were all who had been born and had died following the true religion.\" \nSome Muslims asked God’s messenger about the children of the polytheists, and he replied that they were there too. He continued: “The people who, were half beautiful and half ugly were people Who had mixed a good deed with another which was evil and had been forgiven by God.\"\n\nBukhari transmitted it.</b>",
