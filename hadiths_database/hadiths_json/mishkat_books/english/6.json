Every time they are put back in the fire they will be returned to him during a day whose extent will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among mankind and he sees whether his path is to take him to paradise or to hell.\" \nHe was asked about camels and replied, “If any owner of camels does not pay what is due on them, one thing which is due being to milk them on the day they come down to water,* when the day of resurrection comes a soft sandy plain will be spread out for them, as extensive as possible, he will find that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them pass him the last of them will be brought back to him during a day whose extent will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among mankind and he sees whether his path is to take him to paradise or to hell.\" \nHe was asked about cattle and sheep and said, “If any owner of cattle or sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the day of resurrection comes a soft sandy plain will be spread out for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns, or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them pass him the last of them will be brought back to him during a day whose extent will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among mankind and he sees whether his path is to take him to paradise or to hell”. \nHe was asked about horses and said, “Horses are of three types; to one man they are a load, to another a covering, and to another a reward. The first class is exemplified when a man keeps them in hypocrisy, vainglory and opposition to the people of Islam, so they are a load to him. The second class is exemplified when a man keeps them to be used in God's path and is not forgetful of God’s right concerning their backs and necks, so they are a covering to him. The third class is exemplified when a man keeps them to be used in God's path by the people of Islam and puts them in a meadow and field. The amount of what they eat in that meadow or field will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as will also the amount of their dung and urine. If they break their halter and prance a course or two God will record the amount of their hoofmarks and their dung on his behalf as good deeds. If their master brings them past a river from which they drink, although he did not intend to water them, God will record the amount of what they drink on his behalf as good deeds.” \nHe was asked about asses and said, \"I have had no revelation about asses except this solitary verse of a composite nature, ‘He who does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom’s weight of evil will see it'.”**\n\nMuslim transmitted it.\n\n* This is said to be in order that he may be able to give a drink to passers-by and the poor.\n** Qur’an 99: 7.</b>",

This is the obligatory <i>sadaqa</i> which God’s messenger imposed on the Muslims which God commanded him to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For twenty-four camels or less, a sheep is to be given for every five. When they reach twenty-five to thirty-five, a she-camel in her second year is to be given. When they reach thirty-six to forty-five, a she-camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty-six to sixty, a she-camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty-one to seventy-five, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy-six to ninety, two she-camels in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety-one to a hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year which are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she-camel in her fourth year for every fifty. If anyone has only four camels, no <i>sadaqa</i> is payable on them unless their owner wishes, but when they reach five a sheep is payable on them. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two sheep if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him along with two sheep or twenty dirhams. If any one whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her third year is payable possesses one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, and he must give along with it twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her second year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her third year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep; but if he does not possess a she-camel in her second year as is required and possesses a male camel in its third year, that will be accepted from him and nothing extra is to be demanded along with it. Concerning the <i>sadaqa</i> on sheep which are pasturing, when they number from forty to a hundred and twenty, a sheep is to be given. On over a hundred and twenty up to two hundred two sheep are to be given. On over two hundred up to three hundred three sheep are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a sheep is to be given for every hundred. If a man’s pasturing animals are one less than forty no <i>sadaqa</i> is due on them unless their owner wishes. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be brought forth as <i>sadaqa</i> unless the collector is willing. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of <i>sadaqa</i>. * Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity. On dirhams a fortieth is payable, but if there are only a hundred and ninety nothing is payable unless their owner wishes. \n\nBukhari transmitted it.\n\n* The principle is that there is to be no rearrangement either so that the collector may get more than he might, or the owner may give less than he might.</b>",

When they reach two hundred five dirhams are payable, and that proportion is applicable to larger amounts. Regarding sheep, for every forty sheep up to a hundred and twenty, one sheep is payable.

He therefore sent to them an angel who came to the leper and asked him what he would like best and he replied, “A good colour, a good skin, and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people.” Thereupon he stroked him and his loathsomeness departed and he was given a good colour and a good skin. He then asked What property he would like best and he replied that he would like camels—or perhaps he said cattle, for Ishaq* was uncertain, but either the leper or bald man said camels and the other said cattle. He was given a she-camel ten months gone with young, the angel expressing the wish that God’s blessing might accompany it. \nHe then went to the bald man and asked him what he would like best and he replied, \"Good hair, and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people.” Thereupon he stroked him and it departed from him and he was given good hair. He then asked what property he would like best and he replied that he would like cattle, so he was given a pregnant cow, the angel expressing the wish that God’s blessing might accompany it. \nHe then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best, and he replied, \"That God should restore my sight to me so that I may see people.” Thereupon he stroked him and God restored his sight to him. He then asked what property he would like best and he replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant ewe. \nFlocks and herds were produced for the three men, the one having a wadi with camels, the second one with cattle, and the third one with sheep. Then the angel came to the one who had been a leper in the form and appearance of a leper and said, “I am a poor man whose resources are exhausted in my journey, and my only means of arriving at my destination are dependent on God and then on you, so I ask you by Him who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property for a camel by which I may get to the end of my journey,” but he replied, \"I have many dues to pay.” He then said, \"I seem to recognise you. Were you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom God gave property?” He replied, \"I became heir to this property as one great in dignity from one great in dignity.”** Then he said, \"If you are lying, may God return you to your former condition.” \nHe went to the one who had been bald in the form of a bald man and said the same as he had said to the other and received a similar reply, so he said, \"If you are lying, may God return you to your former condition.” \nHe then went to the one who had been blind in the form and appearance of a blind man and said, \"I am a poor man and a traveller whose resources are exhausted in my journey, and my only means of arriving at my destination are dependent on God and then on you, so I ask you by Him who restored your sight to you for a sheep by which I may get to the end of my journey.\" He replied, “I have been blind and God restored my sight to me, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by God that I shall not importune you today for anything you take, as I give it for God's sake.\" \nHe said, “Keep your property, for you have all simply been put to a test, and God is pleased with you and displeased with your two companions.” \n\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)\n\n* Ishaq b.

Wear your lower garment halfway up to the knee, but if you dislike that, let it go down to the ankles; on no account, however, must you let it trail, for that is a kind of pride, and God does not like pride.
