By Him who sent me with the truth, God shows more pity towards His servants than the mother of young birds shows to her young. Take them back and put them where you got them, their mother being with them.” So he took them back. \n*The use of the first person seems strange here.

        "hadithText": "‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As reported God’s messenger as saying there are two characteristics which will not be retained by any Muslim without his entering paradise. While they are easy, those who act upon them are few. One should say ‘Glory be to God’ ten times after every prayer, ‘Praise be to God’ ten times and ‘God is most great’ ten times. (He said he had seen God’s messenger counting them on his hand, and saying, “That is a hundred and fifty on the tongue, but one thousand five hundred in the scale”).[The three phrases each said ten times after the five times of prayer makes a hundred and fifty, and as a good deed gets a ten-fold reward the total is treated as one thousand five hundred.] When he goes to his bed he should say ‘Glory be to God,’ ‘God is most Great’ and ‘Praise be to God’ a hundred times, for that is a hundred on the tongue, but a thousand in the scale. He asked them which of them could commit two thousand five hundred sins in a day and a night.* He was asked how they could not retain these characteristics, and told them that the devil comes to a man while he is engaged in prayer, calling such and such and such and such to his memory until he turns away and perhaps may not do it. He also comes to him on his bed and keeps on making him sleep till he falls asleep.\n*The thousand plus the preceding fifteen hundred make two thousand five hundred good deeds with which the man who observes the two characteristics mentioned is credited, and as one could hardly commit as many sins in a day and a night there is a balance in his favour.\n\nTirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it. In Abu Dawud's version he said, “Two qualities or two characteristics will not be adhered to by a Muslim ...” And also in his version after saying “One thousand five hundred in the scale” he said, “When he goes to his bed he should say ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times and ‘Glory be to God’ thirty-three times.” In most texts of <i>al-Masabih</i> it is given on the authority of ‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar.</b>",

        "hadithText": "He reported God’s messenger as saying, “God has angels who go about on the roads seeking those who remember God, and when they find people doing so they call to one another, ‘Come to what you are looking for’, and surround them with their wings up to the lowest heaven.” He said that their Lord then asks them, although He is best informed about them, “What are my servants saying?” They reply, “They are extolling, magnifying, praising and glorifying Thee.” He asks whether they have seen Him, and when they reply, “No indeed, they have not seen Thee,” He asks how they would act if they had seen Him, to which they reply, “If they had seen Thee they would have engaged more earnestly in worshipping and glorifying Thee, and would have extolled Thee much more.” He then says, “What are they asking for?” and they reply, “They are asking Thee for paradise.” He asks whether they have seen it, and when they reply, “No indeed, my Lord, they have not seen it,” He asks how they would act if they had seen it to which they reply, “If they had seen it they would have been more intensely eager for it, would have asked more earnestly for it, and would have had a greater desire for it.” He asks what they are seeking refuge from, to which they reply that it is from hell. He asks whether they have seen it, and when they reply, “No indeed, my Lord, they have not seen it,” He asks how they would act if they had seen it, to which they reply, “If they had seen it they would have been more earnest in flying from it and fearing it.” He then says, “I call you to witness that I have forgiven them.” One of the angels says, “Among them is so and so who does not belong to their number, but has come only for something he wants,” and He replies, “They are people who are seated together, and he who sits with them will not be miserable.” \n\nBukhari transmitted it.\n\nIn Muslim's version he said that God has angels who travel round to a great extent looking for meetings where remembrance is being made of God, and when they find a meeting where this is being done they sit with them and surround one another, with their wings so as to fill the space between them and the lowest heaven. When the people separate they ascend up to heaven, and God who knows best asks them where they have come from. They reply, “We have come from Thy servants on the earth who are extolling and magnifying Thee, declaring Thy unity, praising Thee and making request of Thee.” He says, “For what are they asking me?” and they reply, “They are asking Thee for Thy paradise.” He asks whether they have seen His paradise, and when they reply, “No my Lord.” He asks how they would act if they had seen His paradise. They say, “They are also seeking Thy protection.” He asks, “From what are they seeking my protection?” and they reply, “From Thy fire.” He asks whether they have seen His fire, and when they reply that they have not, He asks how they would act if they had seen His fire. They say, “They are also asking Thy forgiveness,” to which He replies, “I have forgiven them, given them what they have asked for, and protected them from what they sought protection.” They say, “My Lord, so and so, a sinner, is among them, who just happening to pass by sat down with them.” He replies, “Him also I have forgiven. They are the people by reason of whom their associate will not be miserable.”</b>",
