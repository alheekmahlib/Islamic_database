When you meet the polytheists who are your enemy summon them to three things, and accept whichever of them they are willing to agree to, and refrain from them. Then* summon them to Islam, and if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them. Then summon them to leave their abodes and transfer to the abode of the Emigrants, and tell them that if they do so they will have the same rights and responsibilities as the Emigrants; but if they refuse to transfer from them tell them they will be like the desert Arabs who are Muslims, subject to God’s jurisdiction which applies to the believers, but will have no spoil or booty unless they strive with the Muslims. If they refuse demand the <i>jizya</i> from them, and if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them; but if they refuse seek God’s help and fight with them. When you invest a fortress and its people wish you to grant them the protection of God and His prophet, grant them neither but grant them your protection and that of your companions, for it is less serious to break your guarantee of protection and that of your companions than to break that of God and His Messenger. If you invest a fortress and its people offer to capitulate and have the matter referred to God’s jurisdiction, do not grant this, but let them capitulate and have the matter referred to your jurisdiction, for you do not know whether or not you will hit on God’s jurisdiction regarding them.” \n\n* What follows gives in detail the three things mentioned above.\n\nMuslim transmitted it.</b>",

If you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, if you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God’s Messenger then said, “Set Thumama free.” He went off to some palm-trees near the mosque, and after bathing he entered the mosque and said, “I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. I swear by God, Muhammad, that there was no face on the face of the earth more hateful to me than yours, but your face has become the dearest of all to me.

I then caught up on ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and asked him what was the matter with the people, to which he replied that it was what God had commanded.1 Then they returned and the Prophet sat down and said, \"If anyone kills a man and can prove it he will get his spoil.” I said, \"Who will testify for me?” and then sat down. The Prophet said the same again and I said, \"Who will testify for me?”2 and then sat down. Again the Prophet said the same and I stood up He asked, \"What is the matter with you, Qatada?” and when I informed him a man said, \"He has spoken the truth. I have his spoil, so make him agreeable to take something in exchange.” Abu Bakr said, “In that case I swear by God that he did not do so. One of God’s heroes3 does not fight for God and His Messenger and then give you his spoil.” The Prophet said he had spoken the truth and told the man to hand it over to me. He did so, and I bought a garden among the B. Salima. This was the first property I acquired in the Islamic period. \n\n    1. He wondered why the Muslims had fled from the enemy, and 'Umar replied that it was what God had decreed.\n    2. There is doubt as to whether Abu Qatada spoke aloud the first two times, or inwardly.

        "hadithText": "Salama b. al-Akwa‘ said: God’s Messenger sent his riding-beasts with his servant Rabah and I went along with him. In the morning ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Fazari raided God’s Messenger’s riding-beasts, so I went up on a mound and shouted three times facing Medina, “A morning raid!” I then went after the people shooting arrows at them and composing words in the <i>rajaz</i> metre saying, “I am the son of al-Akwa‘; today is the day [of the destruction] of the ignoble ones.”* I kept on shooting at them and killing their beasts so that they had to go on foot till there was no riding beast of God’s Messenger created by God which I had not gone ahead of. Then I followed them shooting at them till they threw away more than thirty cloaks and thirty lances to lighten themselves, and they threw nothing away without my putting stones on it to mark it for God’s Messenger and his companions to notice them. This went on till I saw God’s Messenger’s horsemen. Aba Qatada, God's Messenger's horseman, caught up on 'Abd ar-Rahman and killed him, and God's Messenger said, “Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman Salama.” He then gave me two portions a horseman’s and a footman’s, and after giving me them both he took me up behind him on al-‘Adba’ on our way back to Medina. \n\n*The line, which is evidently an example of the dimeter of the <i>rajaz</i> metre, has something missing at the beginning. It goes:       انا ابن الاکوع والیوم الرضع             \nThe full form of the <i>rajaz</i> has the foot <i>mustaf'ilun</i> six times; the dimeter has it four times. In the line above two extra syallables are required at the beginning.\n\nMuslim transmitted it.</b>",

Saying that there was dishonesty about spoil among them he told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man’s hand stuck in his he said there was dishonesty about spoil among them. They brought him a head of gold like a cow’s head an when he had laid it down the fire came and devoured the spoil.* A version has, \"Spoils were not allowable to anyone before us .Then God allowed spoils to us.

Makhrama and Marwan b. al-Hakam told that the Prophet went out in the year of al-Hudaibiya with over ten hundreds of his companions, and when he came to Dhul Hulaifa he garlanded and marked the votive animals, entered the sacred state for an <i>‘umra</i>, and then moved on. When he came to the mountain pass by which one descends to Mecca his riding-beasts knelt down and the people said, “Go on, go on! Al-Qaswa’ has become jaded.” But the Prophet said, “Al- Qaswa’ has not become jaded, for that is not a characteristic of hers, but He who restrained the elephant1 has restrained her.” Then he said, “By Him in whose hand my soul is, they will not ask me any good thing by which they honour what God has made sacred without my giving them it.” He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from the road to Mecca and stopped at the farthest point of al-Hudaibiya at a pool with little water which the people collected in small quantities and soon exhausted. Complaint of thirst was made to God’s Messenger, so he drew an arrow from his quiver and ordered them to put it in it, whereupon to their astonishment it kept gushing out to them with water till they left it. Meanwhile Budail b. Warqa’ al Khuza’i came with some members of Khuza’a and ‘Urwa b. Mas'ud joined him. He went on with the tradition2 to the point where he said that when Suhail b. ‘Amr came the Prophet said, “Write: This is what Muhammad God's Messenger has decided.” Suhail protested, “I swear by God that if we knew you were God’s Messenger we would not turn you away from the House or fight with you; but write: Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” The Prophet replied, “I swear by God that I am God’s Messenger even if you disbelieve me; write Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” Suhail said, “And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without your sending him back to us.\" Then when he finished drawing up the document God’s Messenger said to his companions, \"Get up and sacrifice, and then shave.” Thereafter some believing women came and God most high sent down, \"O you who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants…”3 God most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. When the Prophet returned to Medina Abu Basir, a man of Quraish who was a Muslim, came to him and they sent two men to look for him, so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhul Hulaifa and alighted to eat some dates which they had Abu Basir said to one of the men, \"I swear by God, so and so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; let me look at it.” He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled from him and when he reached Medina went running into the mosque. The Prophet said, “This man has seen something frightful.” He said, “I swear by God that my companion has been killed, and I am as good as dead.”4 Abu Basir arrived and the Prophet said, \"Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had some kinsfolk!”5 When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal b. Suhail escaped and joined Abu Basir, and it became the practice that every man of Quraish who went out having accepted Islam joined Abu Basir, till a band of them collected. Whenever they heard of a caravan which belonged to Quraish going out to Syria they intercepted it, killed the men and seized their goods; so Quraish sent a message to the Prophet adjuring him by God and the ties of relationship to send instructions to them to stop, and agreeing that anyone who came to him would be safe. So the Prophet sent them instructions. \n\n    1. Cf. Al-Qur'an; 105.\n    2. This indicates that a part of Bukhari’s tradition is omitted here.\n    3. Al-Qur'an; 60:10.\n    4. Literally “and I am killed.\"\n    5. Literally “would that he had someone!” It probably means that the Prophet wished Abu Basir had had some kinsfolk to whom he could go, and so save him the necessity of returning him to Mecca.\n    6. Bukhari's tradition is very long. In the version given here it is much reduced, the purpose evidently being to give the essential parts of it without including every detail.\n\nBukhari transmitted it.6</b>",
