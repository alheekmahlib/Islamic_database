When she came back Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sitting (in the house). She said, \"I offered that to them, but they insisted that the right to inherit from me should be theirs.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) heard that and 'Aishah (RA) told him about it.

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then stood up among the people to address them. So, after praising and extolling Allah, he said, \"To proceed; what is the matter with some men who make conditions which are not in the Book of Allah, the Might, the Majestic? Any condition which is not in Allah's Book is invalid. Even if there are a hundred conditions, Allah's Decision is more valid and Allah's Condition is more binding.
