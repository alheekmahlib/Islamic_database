        "hadithText": "Jabir bin 'Abdullah (RAA) narrated, ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed Hajj (on the 10th year of Hijrah), and we set out with him (to perform Hajj). When we reached Dhul-Hulaifah, Asma` bint 'Umais gave birth to Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr. She sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ) (asking him what she should do). He said, \"Take a bath, bandage your private parts and make the intention for Ahram.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida’ (the place where he started his Ihram). He then started pronouncing the Talbiyuh, saying: \"Labbaika Allahumma labbaik labbaika la sharika laka labbaik, innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, la sharika lak (O Allah! I hasten to You. You have no partner. I hasten to You. All praise and grace is Yours and all Sovereignty too; You have no partner). When we came with him to the House (of Allah), he placed his hands on the Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) and kis+sed it. He then started to make seven circuits (round the Ka’bah), doing ramal (trotting) in three of them and walking (at his normal pace) four other circuits. Then going to the place of Ibrahim (Maqam Ibrahim), there he prayed two rak'at. He then returned to the Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) placed his hands on it and kissed it. Then he went out of the gate to Safa, and as he approached it, he recited: “Verily as-Safa and Marwah are among the signs appointed by Allah,\"(2:158), adding, “I begin with what Allah began.\" He first mounted as-Safa until he saw the House, and facing the Qiblah he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him and said: ‘La ilaha illa-llah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd, wa huwa 'ala kulli shai’in qadeer, la ilaha illa-llahu wahdahu anjaza wa'dahu, wa nas ara 'abdahu, wa hazamal ahzaba wahdah’ (There is no God but Allah, He is One, and has no partner. His is the dominion, and His is the praise and He has Power over all things. There is no God but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and defeated the confederates alone.\") He said these words three times making supplications in between. He then descended and walked towards Marwah, and when his feet touched the bottom of the valley, he ran; and when he began to ascend, he walked (at his normal pace) until he reached Marwah. There he did as he had done at Safa…. \nWhen it was the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode his mount, and there he led the Dhur (noon), ‘Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), ‘Isha and Fajr (dawn) prayers. He then waited a little until the sun had risen, and commanded that a tent be pitched at Namirah (close to Arafat). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), continued on until he came to Arafah and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namirah. There he got down until the sun had passed its meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa’ be brought and saddled for him, then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people with the well-known sermon Khutbat al-Wada (the Farewell Sermon). Then the Adhan was pronounced and later on the Iqamah and the Prophet led the Dhuhr (noon) prayer. Then another Iqamah was pronounced and the Prophet led the Asr (afternoon) prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two. The Messenger of Allah then mounted his camel and came to the place where he was to stay. He made his she-camel, al-Qaswa turn towards the rocky side, with the pedestrian path lying in front of him. He faced the Qiblah, and stood there until the sun set, and the yellow light diminished somewhat, and the disc of the sun totally disappeared. He pulled the nose string of al-Qaswa’ so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and pointing with his right hand, advised the people to be moderate (in speed) saying: “O people! Calmness! Calmness!\" Whenever he passed over an elevated tract of land, he slightly loosened the nose-string of his camel until she climbed up. This is how he reached al-Muzdalifah. There he led the Maghrib (sunset) and Isha prayers with one Adhan, and two lqamas, and did not pray any optional prayers in between them. The Messenger of Allah then lay down until dawn and then offered the Fajr (dawn) prayer with an Adhan and an Iqamah when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa’, and when he came to Al-Mash‘ar Al-Haram (The Sanctuary Landmark, which is a small mountain at al-Muzdalifah) he faced the Qiblah, and supplicated to Allah, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness and Oneness, and kept standing until the daylight was very clear. Then he set off quickly before the sun rose, until he came to the bottom of the valley of Muhassir where he urged her (al·Qaswa’) a little. He followed the middle road, which comes out at the greatest Jamarah (one of the three stoning sites called Jamrat-ul ‘Aqabah), he came to Jamarah which is near the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles, saying, Allahu Akbar` while throwing each of them in a manner in which small pebbles are thrown (holding them with his fingers) and this he did while at the bottom of the valley. He then went to the Place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand (he brought 100 camels with him and he asked ’Ali to sacrifice the rest). The Messenger of Allah again rode and came to the House (of Allah), where he performed Tawaf al-Ifada and offered the Dhuhr prayer at Makkah….’ Muslim transmitted this hadith through a very long narration describing the full details of the Hajj of the Prophet</b>",
