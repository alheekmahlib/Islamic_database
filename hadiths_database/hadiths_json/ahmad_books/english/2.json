He said: I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. \nThey are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter. O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.” \n\nHe said: He addressed the people on Friday and was attacked on Wednesday.</b>",

The Prophet of Allah(ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshipped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said: O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you. Then Allah revealed the words: `(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession` [al Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, defeated the mushrikeen; seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, 'Ali and 'Umar رضي الله عنهم (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said: O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers, I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?` I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand. So and so ­ a relative of ʼUmar's- ­ over \nto me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are \ntheir prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day, I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping I said: O Messenger of Allah , tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping, I will weep too, and is it is not, then I will make myself weep with you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, All Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took `[al Anfal 8:67­-68] ­ i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done of taking the \nransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him, his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: 'From where does this come to us?`Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).'

The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshiped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it back on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said, “O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you.” Then Allah revealed the words: “(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession’” (al-Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, caused the mushrikeen to be defeated, seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, ‘Ali and ʼUmar (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said, “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers. I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?” I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand so and so—a relative of ‘Umar's—to me so that I may strike his neck, You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over so and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day. I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping. I will weep too, and if it is not, then I will make myself weep with you.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree”—a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). Then Allah revealed the words: “It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter, And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.” [al-Anfal 8:67-68] i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done for taking the ransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him; his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: ‘From where does this come to us?’ Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).’ And Allah has power over all things” [Al ‘Imran 3:165]</b>",

When we were partway there, 'Umar turned aside and I turned aside with him, bringing the jug. He relieved himself, then he came to me and I poured water onto his hands, and he did wudoo’. I said: “O Ameer al -Mu'mineen, who are the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) of whom Allah said: ‘If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)’?” [at-Tahreem 66:4] 'Umar said, “How strange of you, O Ibn  'Abbas”, (az-Zuhri said: By Allah, he did not like the question, but he did not conceal anything.) He said, “They were Hafsah and 'A'ishah.” Then he started to narrate the hadeeth and said: We people of Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do\nyou argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His\nMessenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than\nyou – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.\nWe were saying that Ghassan were shoeing their horses to attack us. My friend went down, then he came to me at night and knocked on my door, then he called out to me. I went out to him and he said: Something terrible has happened! I said: What? Have Ghassan come? He said: No, it is more terrible than that and worse. The Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything. I turned to leave, then the slave called me and said: Go in, he has given you permission. So I went in and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He was resting on a reed mat that had left marks on his side. I said: O Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He looked up at me and said, “No.” I said: Allah Akbar! if you had seen us, O Messenger of Allah, we Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost. Does one of them feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His Messenger (ﷺ),then she will be doomed? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I entered upon Hafsah and I said: Do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour (i.e. ‘Aa'ishah) is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled again. I said: O Messenger of Allah, may I speak to you freely? He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him.</b>",

The people are telling me to appoint a caliph after me. Allah will not cause His caliphate or His religion to be lost, or that with which He sent His Prophet (ﷺ). If I die, then the caliphate is to be decided by a council of these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died, then whichever of them you swear allegiance to, listen to him and obey. I know that there are some men then who will seek to undermine this matter, and I have sought them with these two hands of mine in support of Islam. It they do that, then those are the enemies of Allah, the misguided disbelievers. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything of more concern to me than kalalah. I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah  about it and he never spoke to me in such a harsh manner as he did with regard to that, to such an extent that he poked me in the chest or side with his hand or his finger and said: `O `Umar: The verse at the end of Soorah an Nisa’ that was revealed in summer is sufficient for you.” If I live, I will pass a judgement concerning it that no one who reads Qur`an or who does not read Qur`an will dispute. Then `Umar said: O Allah, bear witness concerning the governors of the regions; I sent them to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet (ﷺ), and to divide the sai` among them, and to judge between them on a fair basis, and whatever they found difficult they were to refer to me. Then he said: O people, you eat two plants that I think are nothing but distasteful, this garlic and onion. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would see that is the smell of these things was found on a man, he would be taken by the hand and led out to al-Baqee`. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.ʻUmar said this in a khutbah on Friday, and was stabbed on Wednesday 26 Dhul Hijjah.</b>",

        "hadithText": "It was narrated that Abu Firas suid: `Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.\n\n<p>\nIt was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.</b>",

        "hadithText": "It was narrated that `Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah said: I was sitting beside Ibn ‘Umar, and we were waiting for the funeral of Umm Aban bint `Uthman bin `Affan. `Amr bin `Uthman was also present. Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us). When we came to Madinah, it was not long before Ameer al Muʼmineen [ʼUmar} was attacked. Suhaib came, saying O my brother, O my friend! `Umar said: Do you not know, or have you not heard, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of some of his family`s crying.” “Abdullah understood it as general in meaning, but ‘Umar said: some of [their] weeping. I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.\n\n<p>\n`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep? For the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.`</b>",
