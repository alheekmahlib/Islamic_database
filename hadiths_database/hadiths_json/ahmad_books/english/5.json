He turned to them and said: `Calmly, O people.” Then he came to Jam` and led them in praying two prayers, Maghrib and `Isha`. Then he stayed all night until morning came, then he came to Quzah and stood at Quzah, and said: `This is the place of standing and all of Jam` is a place of standing.” Then he moved on until he came to Muhassir, where he stood, then he struck his she-camel and she trotted until he crossed the valley, then he reined her in. Then he put al-Fadl behind him (on his mount) and carried on until he came to the Jamrah. He stoned it, then he came to the place of sacrifice and said: `This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.` He [the narrator] said: A young woman of Khath’am asked him: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory, Will it be acceptable if I perform Hajj on his behalf? He said: `Yes; perform Hajj on behalf of your father.` And he twisted al Fadl`s neck (to turn his face away). Al-`Abbas said to him: O Messenger of Allah, why did you twist the neck of your cousin? He said: `I saw a young man and a young woman and I was not certain that they would be safe from the Shaitan.` Then a man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I shaved my head before offering a sacrifice. He said: “Offer your sacrifice, there is no problem.” Then another man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I did tawafal-ifadah before shaving my head. He said: “Shave your head or cut your hair, there is no problem.` Then he came to the Ka`bah and circumambulated it, then he came to Zamzam and said: `O Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib, it is your right to draw water for pilgrims. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water myself.`</b>",

He said: `No problem, go ahead and shave your head.” Then another man came to him and said: I stoned the Jamrah and shaved my head and put on my ordinary clothes, but I did not offer the sacrifice.

I started shaking it right and left, forwards and backwards until, when I had managed to loosen it, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said to me: “Throw it down.” I threw it down and it broke like a glass bottle, Then I came down and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  and I ran and hid among the houses lest any of the people see us.</b>",

        "hadithText": "It was narrated that `Ubaidullah bin ‘Iyad bin `Amr al-Qari said: `Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali           (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.</b>",

They are the closest of the enemy to you, but if you go to your enemy, I am afraid that these people may attack what you leave behind. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `Some rebels will emerge from my ummah, your prayer will be as nothing compared to their prayer, and your fasting will be as nothing compared to their fasting, and your recitation will be as nothing compared to their recitation. They will recite the Qur`an, thinking that it is in their favour, but it will be against them; it will go no further than their throats. They will pass out of Islam as the arrow passes out of the prey. The sign of that is that among them will be a man who has an upper arm but no forearm, and on it will be something like the nipple of a breast, on which will be some white hairs.` If the army that fights them knew what reward they will have, as spoken on the lips of their Prophet (ﷺ), they would cease striving and rely on that.

It is for the one who needs it and for the one whose home is remote. Then he entered ihram for Hajj and `Umrah together. ‘Uthman (رضي الله عنه) turned to the people and said: Did I forbid it?

Verily, my Salah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). He has no partner, And of this I have been commanded, and I am one of the Muslims [Abun-Nadr said: and I am the first of the Muslims]. O Allah, there is no god but You. You are my Lord and I am Your slave. I have wronged myself and I admit my sin, so forgive me all my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You. Guide me to the best of conduct, for none can guide to that except You and divert from me bad conduct, for no one can divert it from me except You. Blessed and exalted are You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You.” When he bowed, he said: `O Allah, to You I have bowed, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My hearing my sight, my brain, my bones and my sinews submit to You.` When he rose from bowing he said: `Allah hears those who praise Him. Our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens, the earth and that which is between them and filling whatever else You will besides.” When he prostrated he said: “O Allah, to You I have prostrated, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My face has prostrated to the One Who created it, shaped it and gave it a good shape, and opened its hearing and sight. Blessed be Allah, the Best of creators.` Then he after said the salam at the end of the prayer: `O Allah, forgive me my past and future sins, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly, what I have transgressed and what You know more than I. You are the One Who brings forward and the One Who puts back, there is no god but You.`</b>",

The people of the oasis caught a partridge and cooked it in water and salt, then they cut it into pieces to make thareed, and we offered it to `Uthman and his companions, but they refused to eat it. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said: It is game that I did not catch and I did not order it to be caught; it was caught by people who are not in ihram, and they have offered it to us, so there is nothing wrong with it. `Uthman said, Who can say something about this issue? They said: `Ali. So he sent for `Ali (رضي الله عنه), who came to him. `Abdullah bin Al-Harith said: It is as if I can see ‘Ali when he came, brushing some leaves off his hands. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said to him: Game that we did not catch and we did not order it to be caught; it was caught by people who are not in ihram and they offered it to us, so there is nothing wrong with it. ‘Ali got angry and said: I adjure any man who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when the meat of an onager was brought and the Messenger of Allah      (ﷺ) said: “We are people who are in ihram; give it to people who are not in ihram.” Twelve of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bore witness to that. Then `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I adjure by Allah, any man who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when some ostrich eggs were brought and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `We are people who are in ihram; give them to people who are not in ihram.` Fewer than twelve men bore witness.

He said: What is it, may you be bereft of your father? He said. Something I heard `Ali (رضي الله عنه) say. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  sent me, az-Zubair and Abu Marthad on a mission, and we were all horsemen. He said: `Go to Rawdat Khakh, for there you will find a woman who has a letter with her from Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah to the mushrikeen; bring it to me.` So we went on our horses until we caught up with her where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had told us, travelling on a camel of hers. He [Hatib] had written to the people of Makkah, telling them about the march of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We said to her. Where is the letter you have with you? She said: I do not have any letter. We made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage for it, but we did not find anything. My two companions said: We do not see any letter with her, I said: You know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not tell a lie. Then I swore: By the One by whom oaths are sworn, you will give us the letter or we will remove your clothes. She stretched out her hand to her girdle, which was wrapped around her, and brought out the letter. I brought it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he has betrayed Allah and His Messenger and the believers; let me strike his neck. He said: `O Hatib, what made you do what you did?` He said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, it is not that I do not believe in Allah and His Messenger, but I wanted to do a favour for the people by means of which Allah might protect my family and my property, for every one of your Companions has some of his people there through whom Allah will protect his family and his property. He said: You have spoken the truth, do not say anything to him but good.` ʻUmar said: O, Messenger of Allah, he betrayed Allah and His Messenger and the believers, let me strike his neck. He said. `ls he not one of the people of Badr? How do you know? Perhaps Allah looked upon them and said. “Do what you like, for Paradise is guaranteed for you.ʻʼ ʻUmarʻs eyes filled with tears and he said: Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger know best.</b>",

She said: I felt too shy to ask him. So we went together and I said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah I have brought water until I started to feel pain in my chest. And Fatimah said: I have ground flour until my hands hurt. Allah has brought you plenty of captives, so give us a servant. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “By Allah, I will not give it to you and leave ahlus-suffah starving when I have nothing to spend on them. Rather I will sell them (the captives) and spend the price on (ahlus-suffah).” So they went back. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came, when they were under the cover which, if it covered their heads, it left their feet bare, and if it covered their feet, it left their heads bare. They wanted to get up, but he said: `Stay where you are.` And then he said: `Shall I not tell you of something that is better than what you asked for?” They said: Yes.

And when you go to your bed, glorify Allah thirty-three times, praise Him thirty-three times and magniÍy Him thirty-four times.” He said: By Allah, I never omitted that from the time the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me.

        "hadithText": "It was narrated that `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: When we came to Madinah we ate from its fruits and did not feel comfortable in it, and we became ill. The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet! Allah, may He be exalted, supported you with a noble angel.` `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: We took prisoners, and from among Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, we captured al-`Abbas, ‘Aqeel and Nawfal bin al-Harith.</b>",

He was standing and I did not know which of the two fingers it was. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  forbade me to use red saddle cloths or to wear garments made from a blend of linen and silk. We said to him: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, what is the red saddle cloth? He said: Something that women make for their husbands to put on their mounts. We said: What are garments made from a blend of linen and silk? He said: Cloth that comes to us from Syria, with wide silken stripes in a twisted shape like citrons. Abu Burdah said: When I saw the garment that is called as-Sabani (from a place in North Africa], I realised that this is what it was.</b>",

The lion wounded them, and some of them died in the pit and some of them were taken out and then died.

Come and I will judge between you, if you accept it (all well and good), otherwise refer the matter to the Prophet (ﷺ).” He ruled that one quarter of the diyah should be given for the first one, one third of the diyah for the second one, half of the diyah for the third one and the complete diyah for the fourth one. Some of them accepted it and some of them did not like it. And he imposed the diyah on the tribes of the people who had crowded one another in that place. So they referred the matter to the Prophet (ﷺ). Bahz said: Hammad said: I think he said: He was reclining, then he sat up and said: “I shall judge between you.” Then he was told that ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) had issued such and such a verdict, and he approved of it, `Affan said: `I shall judge between you.”</b>",

He did not turn to them, but he said: “Calmly, O people.` Then he came to Jam` and offered two prayers there - i.e., Maghrib and Isha`. Then he stayed there all night, and when morning came he stood at Quzah, and said: `This is Quzah. This is the place of standing and all of Jam’ is a place of standing.` Then he moved on and when he came to Muhassir, he struck his she-camel and she trotted until he crossed the valley, then he reined her in and put al-Fadl behind him (on his mount). He carried on until he came to the Jamrah. He stoned it, then he came to the place of sacrifice and said: “This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.` Then a young woman of Khath`am came to him and said: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory. Will it be acceptable if I perform Hajj on his behalf ? He said: `Yes; perform Hajj on behalf of your father.” And he turned al-Fadl`s neck. Al-`Abbas said to him: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why did you turn the neck of your cousin? He said: `I saw a young man and a young woman and I was afraid that the Shaitan [might tempt] them.` A man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I did tawaful-ifadah before shaving my head. He said: `Go ahead and shave your head or cut your hair, there is no problem.” And he came to Zamzam and said: `O Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, it is your right to draw water for pilgrims.

Here I am at Your service, all goodness is in Your hand and evil cannot be attributed to You. My existence is due to You and my return is to You. Blessed and exalted are You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You.` When he bowed, he said: `O Allah, to You I have bowed, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My hearing, my sight, my brain, my bones and my sinews submit to You.` When he rose from bowing he said: “Allah hears the one who praises Him. O Allah our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens, filling the earth, filling that which is between them and filling whatever else You will besides.` When he prostrated he said: “O Allah, to You I have prostrated, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted.

You are the One who brings forward and the One Who puts back, there is no god but You.` `Abdullah said: We heard from Ishaq bin Rahawaih, from an-Nadr bin Shumail, that he said concerning this hadeeth, instead of, `evil cannot be attributed to You,” he said: Evil cannot be used to draw close to You.\n\n\nIt was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه), from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that When he began to pray, he said takbeer, then he said, `I have turned my face.` - and he narrated a similar report, except that he said `and divert from me the worst of conduct.”\n\n\nA similar report was narrated from Al-A`raj, from `Ubaidullah bin Abi Rafi`, from `Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه), from the Prophet (ﷺ).</b>",
