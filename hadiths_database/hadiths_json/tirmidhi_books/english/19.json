This Hadith is been reported from Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab, from Umm Salamah, from the Prophet (saws), through routes other than this and it is similar in meaning. This is the saying of some of the people of knowledge, and it is the view of Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab, and Ahmad and Ishaq went with this Hadith. \r\n\r\nSome of people of knowledge permitted that, they said there is no harm if he takes from his hair and his nails. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, and he used the Hadith of 'Aishah as proof that the Prophet (saws) would dispatch from Al-Madinah with the Hadi, and he would not avoid anything that the Muhrim would avoid.",
