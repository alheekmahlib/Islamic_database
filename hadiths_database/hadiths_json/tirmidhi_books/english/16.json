Then Muhayyisah found 'Abdullah bin Sahl murdered [so he buried him]. Then he went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) along with Huwayyisah bin Mas'ud and Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl. The youngest of the people, Abdur-Rahman, went to speak ahead of his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: \"Let the eldest of you speak.\" So he was silent and two companions spoke. So he conversed with them and they mentioned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about the murder of 'Abdullah bin Sahl. He said to them: \"If fifty of you can swear an oath then you will have the right against the murderer.\" They said: \"How can we take an oath when we did not witness it?\" He said: \"Then fifty of Jews can swear to clear the charge with you?\" They said: \"How could we accept the oaths of a disbelieving people?\" So when he saw that, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid the blood-money.\" \n(Another Chain) from Sahl bin Abi Hathman and Rafi' bin Khadij, and the meaning is similar to this Hadith.</b>",
