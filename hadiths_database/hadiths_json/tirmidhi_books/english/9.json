Allow me to tell you what the Messenger of Allah said on the day following the Conquest of Makkah. My ears heard it, my heard understood it thoroughly, and with my own eyes, I saw the Prophet when he - after glorifying and praising Allah - said: \"Indeed Allah, the Most High, made Makkah a sanctuary, it was not made a sanctuary by the people. So it is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood it, nor to cut down its trees. If anybody tries to use the Messenger of Allah to make an excuse for fighting in it, then say to him: 'Indeed Allah permitted His Messenger and He did not permit you.' Allah only allowed it for me for a few hours of one day, and today its sanctity has returned as it was before. So let the one who is present convey to the one who is absent.\" Abu Shuraih was asked: \"What was Amr bin Sa'eeds reply to you?\" He said: \"I am more knowledgeable about that than you Abu Shuraih! The Haram does not give protection to a disobedient person, nor a person fleeing for murder, nor fleeing for (Kharbah) lawlessness.\"</b>",
