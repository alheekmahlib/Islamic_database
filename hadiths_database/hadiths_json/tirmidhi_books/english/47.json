One night while she was serving me, something of her became exposed for me, so I rushed myself upon her. When the morning came I went to my people to inform them about what happened to me. I said: ‘Accompany me to the Messenger of Allah to inform him about my case.’ They said: ‘No by Allah! We shall not do that, we feat that something will be revealed about us in the Qur’an, or the Messenger of Allah might say something about us, the disgrace of which will remain upon us. But you do and do whatever you want.’” He said: “So I left and I went to the Messenger of Allah, and informed him of my case. He said: ‘You are the one who did that?” I said: ‘I am the one.’ He said: ‘You are the one who did that?” I said: ‘I am the one.’ He said: ‘You are the one who did that?” I said: ‘I am the one, it is before you, so give me Allah’s judgment, for I shall be patient with that.’ He said: ‘Free a slave.’” He said: “I struck the sides of my neck with me hands, and said: ‘No by the One Who sent you with the Truth! I possess nothing besides it.’ He said: ‘Then fast for two months’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Did this occur to me other than when I was fasting?’ He said: ‘Then feed sixty poor people.’ I said: ‘By the One Who sent you with the Truth! We have spent these nights of ours hungry without an evening meal.’ He said: ‘Go to the one with the charity from Banu Ruzaiq, tell him to give it to you, then feed a Wasq of it, on your behalf, to sixty poor people. Then help yourself and your dependants with the remainder of it.’” He said: “I returned to my people and said: ‘I found dejection and bad ideas with you, and I found liberalness and blessing with the Messenger of Allah.

I poured water for his Wudu from a water holder, and I said: ‘O Commander of the Believers! Who are the two women among the wives of the Prophet, about whom Allah said: If your two turn in repentance, you hearts are indeed so inclined?’ He said to me: ‘I am astonished at you O Ibn Abbas!’” – Az-Zubair (one of the narrators) said: “By Allah! He disliked what he asked him, but he did not withhold it from him.” – “He said to me: ‘It was Aishah and Hafsah.’” He said: “Then he began narrating the Hadith to me. He said: ‘We, the people of the Quraish, used to have the upper hand over our women. So when we arrived in Al-Madinah, we found a people whose women had the upper hand over them. Our women began acquiring the habits of their women. One day I became angry with my wife when she started talking back to to me, she said: “What bothers you about that? By Allah! The wives of the Prophet talk back to him, and one of them may stay away from him a whole day until the night?’” “He said: ‘I said to myself: “Whoever among them has done that, then she has thwarted herself and lost.’” “He said: ‘My house was in Al-Awali among those of Banu Umayyah, and I had a neighbor among the Ansar, and he and I would take turns visiting the Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘One day I would visit him and bring the news of the Revealation, and other than that, and one day he would visit him and bring the same. We heard stories that Ghassan were preparing their horses to attack us. He said: ‘One day he came to me in the evening and knocked on my door, so I went out to him. He said: “A horrible thing has happened.” I said: “Ghassan has come?” He said: “Worse than that. The Messenger of Allah has divorced his wives.’” He said: ‘I said to myself: “Hafsah has thwarted herself and is a loser! I though this would happen some day.’” He said: ‘After we prayed Subh, I put on my clothes, then went to visit Hafsah. There I found her crying. I said: “Has the Messenger of Allah divorced (all of you)?” She said: “I do not know. He has secluded himself in the upper room.’” He said: ‘So I wen, and came upon a black slave, I said: “Seek permission for Umar.’” He said: ‘So he entered then came out to me. He said: “I mentioned you to him, but he did not say anything.’” He said: ‘So I went to the Masjid. There I found a group of people sitting around the Minhar weeping, so I sat down with them. Then it became too much for me, so I went to the slave and said: “Seek permission for Umar.” He went in, then he came out to me and said: “I mentioned you to him, but he did not say anything.’” He said: ‘So I went to the Masjid again, and sat there until I could not take it any more, and I went back to the slave and said: “Seek permission for Umar.” He went in, then he came out to me and said: “I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything.’” He said: ‘So I turned to leave, when the slave called me back. He said: “Enter for he has given you permission.’” He said: ‘So I entered, and found the Prophet reclining upon a woven mat, and I saw the marks it left on his side. I said: “O Messenger of Allah! Have you divorced your women?” He said: “No.” I said: “Allahu Akbar! IF you only saw us O Messenger of Allah!

So any of you feel so secure against Allah becoming angry with you because of the anger of the Messenger of Allah, then she will be ruined?’ He said: ‘So the Prophet smiled.’ He said: ‘So I said to Hafsah: “Do not talk back to the Messenger of Allah, and don’t ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be tempted by the behavior of your companions, for she is more beautiful than you, and more loved by the Messenger of Allah.’” He said: ‘So he smiled again, I said: “O Messenger of Allah! May I speak candidily?” He said: “Yes.’” He said: ‘I raised my head and did not see in the house except for three hides. So I said: “O Messenger of Allah! Supplicate to Allah to make your followers prosperous. For verily, He has made the Persians and the Romans prosper, and they do not worship Him.” He then sat up and said: “Do you have some doubts O Ibn Al-Khattab? They are a people whose good has been hastened for them in this world’s life.’” He said: ‘He swore that he would not enter upon his women for a month. So Allah censured him for that, and he made the atonement of an oath.’” Az-Zuhri said: “Urwah informed me that Aishah said: “When twenty-nine days passed, the Prophet entered upon me first, and he said: “O Aishah! I am about to mention something to you, but do not be hasty in reply until you consult your parents.’” She said: ‘Then he recited this Ayah: “O Prophet! Say to your wives.” She said: ‘I knew by Allah! That my parents would not tell me to part with him.’ She said: ‘I said: “Is it about this that I should consult with my parents? Indeed I want Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter.” Ma’mar (one of the narrators) said: “Ayyub informed me that Aishah said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah!

So travel east and west in the earth and look for what is it that intervenes between you an between the news of the heavens.’” He said: “So they went traveling east and west on the earth, seeking whatever it was that had been intervening between them and the news of the heavens. A group of those who were traveling towards Tihamah headed in the direction of the Messenger of Allah, while he was at Nakhlah, enroute to the Ukaz market. He was performing Salat Al-Fajr with his Companions. When they heard the Quran they listened to it, and they said: ‘By Allah! This is what has been intervening between us and the news of the heavens.’” He said: “Then they returned to their people and said: ‘O our people! Verily we heard a wonderful Recitation! It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join anything with our Lord.’ So Allah, Blessed is He and Most High, revealed to His Prophet: Say: ‘It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened.’ So the saying of the jinns was only revealed to him.”\n<br>\n[He said:] With this chain, from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: \"The jinns said to their people: When the worshipper stood up invoking Him in prayer, they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.\" He said: \"When they saw him performing Salat, and his Companions were performing Salãt, and they were prostrating along with his prostrations.\" He said: \"They were amazed at how his Companions obeyed him so they said to their people: When the worshipper stood up invoking Him in prayer, they just made round Him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.\"</b>",

        "hadithText": "Suhaib narrated:\n“When the Messenger of Allah had performed Asr, Hamasa (he began mumbling)” – and Al—Hams according to some of them, is moving the lips as if he is speaking – “It was said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah! After you performed Asr, you were mumbling?’ He said: ‘There was a Prophet among the Prophets, he was amazed with his people, so he said: “Who can stand against these people?” Then Allah revealed to him, that they must choose between some of them suffering from wrath, and between enemies of theirs assaulting them. They chose the wrath. So death was inflicted upon them such that seventy-thousand of them died in one day.’”He said: And when he would narrated this Hadith, he would also narrated another: “There was a king among the kings, and that king had a fortune-teller (Kahin) who would see for him. The fortune teller said: ‘Search for a boy for me, he must be understanding” or he said: “clever and quick, so that I can teach him this knowledge of mine. For verily, I fear that I shall die, and this knowledge will be removed from you, and there will be no one among you who knows it.” He said: “They looked for a boy fitting his description. (After finding one) they ordered him to tend to that fortune teller, and to continue visiting him. So he began his frequent visits, and on the boy’s route, there was a monk at his hermitage.” – Ma’mar said: “I think that during that time, the people at the hermitage were Muslims.” – He said: “They boy began asking that monk questions each time he passed him, and he would not leave him until he informed him, so he said: ‘I only worship Allah.’” He said: “So the boy began spending more time with the monk and arriving late to the fortune-teller. The fortune-teller sent a message to the boy’s family saying: ‘He hardly ever attends me.’ The boy told that to the monk, so the monk said to him: ‘When the fortune-teller asks you where you’ve been, tell him: “I was with my family.” And when your family asks you where you’ve been, then tell them that you were with the fortune-teller.’” He said: “One day, the boy passed by a large group of people being held back by a beast.” Some of them said, it was a lion. He said: “So the boy took a rock and said: ‘O Allah, if what the monk says is true, then I ask you to kill it.’” [He said:] “Then he threw the rock, killing the beast. The people began asking who killed it and some of them replied: ‘It was the boy.’ They were terrified and said: ‘This boy has learned a knowledge that no one else has learned.’” He said: “A blind man heard about him so he said to him: ‘If you can return my sight, I shall give you this and that.’ He said to him: ‘I do not want this from you. However, if your sight is returned to you, would you believe in the One who gave it back to you?’ He said: ‘Yes.’” He said: “So he supplicated to Allah, and He returned his sight to him, and the blind man believed. His case was conveyed to the king, so he sent for him to be brought before him. He said: ‘I shall kill each of you in a manner different than his comrade was killed.’ He called for the monk and the man who used to be blind. He placed a saw upon the forehead of one of them and killed him. Then he killed the other one by a different means. Then he gave orders for the boy, he said: ‘Take him to this or that mountain, and throw him from its peak.’ They brought him to that mountain, and when they reached the place from where they intended to cast him off, they began tumbling off of that mountain, and all of them fell down until none of them remained except for the boy.” He said: “Then he returned and the king ordered that he be brought out to sea and cast into it. So he was brought out to sea, but Allah drowned those who were with him, and He saved him. Then the boy said to the king: ‘You will not kill me until you tie me to the trunk of a tree and shoot me, and when you shoot me, you said: “In the Name of Allah, the Lord of this boy.’” He said: “So he ordered that he be tied, then when he shot him, he said: ‘In the Name of Allah, the Lord of this boy.’ The boy placed his hand upon his temple where he was shot, then he died. The people said: “This boy had knowledge that no one else had! Verily we believe in the Lord of this boy!” He said: It was conveyed to the king “Your efforts have been thwarted by the opposition of these three, now all of these people have opposed you.”\nHe said: “So he had ditches dug, then fire wood was filled into it and a fire was lit. Then he (the king) had all of the people gathered and he said: ‘Whoever leaves his religion, then we shall leave him. And whoever does not leave, we shall cast him into this fire.’ So he began casting them into that ditch.” He said: “Allah, Blessed is He and Most High, said about that: ‘Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel…’ until he reached: ‘…The Almighty, Worthy of all praise!’” He said: “As for the boy, he was buried.” He said: “It has been mentioned, that he was excavated during the time of Umar bin Al-Khattab, and his finger was at his temple, just as he had placed it when he was killed.”</b>",

Some of the people of Hadith have criticized Suhail bin Abi Hazm.\n<br>\n<br>\n[Imam At-Tirmidhi said:] This is how it has\nbeen reported from some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), and others. They were very stern about this - about explaining the\nQur'an without knowledge. As for what has been related from Mujãhid, Qatadah and others, among the people of knowledge, that they would interpret the Qur'an, then it should not be thought about them that they would say something about the Qur'an, or interpret it without knowledge, or according to their own intellect. Rather that which\nproves what we have said has been reported from them, that they would not say something from themselves without knowledge. \nHusain bin Mahdi Al-Basri narrated to us (he said: AbdurRazzaq narrated to us, from\nMa'mar, from Qatadah who said):\n\"There is no Ayah in the Qur'an except that I have heard something about it.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nIbn Abi 'Umar narrated to us (he said): \"Sufyan bin 'Uyainah narrated to us, from Al-A'mash who said: 'Mujãhid said: If you\nrecited the recitation of Ibn Mas'ud, you would not need to ask Ibn 'Abbãs about much of what you ask him regarding the Qur'an.\"</b>",

My slave stands and says: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of All that exists.\" So Allah, Blessed is He and Most High says: \"My slave has expressed his gratitude to Me.\" He says: \"The Merciful, the Beneficent. So he says: \"My slave has praised Me.\" He says: Owner of the Day of Reckoning. He says: \"My slave has glorified Me. And this is for Me, and between Me and My slave is: It is You alone whom we worship and it is You alone from whom we seek aid\" until the end of the Surah \"This is for My slave and My slave shall have what he asks for.\" So he says: Guide us to the straight path.

He stood with them, until he was finished dealing with what they wanted. Then he took me by the hand until he brought me to his house. A slave girl brought him a cushion to sit on, and I sat in front of him. He expressed thanks and praise for Allah then said: 'What has caused you to flee from saying La Ilaha Illallah? Do you know of another god other than Him?'\" He said: \"I said: 'No.'\" He said: \"Then he talked for some time, and then said: 'You refuse to say Allahu Akbar because you know that there is something greater than Allah?'\" He said: \"I said: 'No.' He said: 'Indeed the Jews are those who Allah is wrath with, and the Christians have strayed.'\" He said: \"I said: 'Indeed I am a Muslim, Hanif.'\" He said: \"I saw his face smiling with happiness.\" He said: \"Then he ordered that I stop with him at the home of a man from the Ansar, whom he would frequently visit in the mornings and the evenings. When I was with him at night, a people in woolen garments of these Nimar (a cloth with certain patters, and the word appeared before) came. Then he performed Salat and stood to encourage them (the people) to give (charity) to them. Then he said: 'Even with a Sa' or half a Sa', or a handful or part of a handful, to save the face of one of you from the heat of Hell, or the Fire. And even if it be by a date or a part of a date - for indeed one of you shall meet Allah and it shall be said to him what I say to you: \"Have I not given hearing and seeing to you?\" He shall say: \"Of course.\" It will be said: \"Have I not given you wealth and children?\" He shall say: \"Of course.\" It will be said: \"So where is what you have sent forth for yourself?\" He will look before him and behind him, on his right and on his left, but he shall not find anything to protect his face from the heat of Hell. Let one of you protect his face from the Fire, even if with part of a date, and if he does not find that, then with a good statement. For indeed I do not fear poverty for you - Allah will aid you and grant you, such that a woman can travel on her camel howda from Yathrib to Al-Hirah, or further, without fear of being robbed.'

Allah knew of his heed for her and her need for a husband, so Allah, Blessed and Most High, revealed: 'And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period...' up to His saying: '... and you do not know (2:232).'

        "hadithText": "Narrated Qatadah bin An-Nu'man:\n\"There was a household among us called Banu Ubairiq, among whom was a Bishr, a Bushair, and a Mubashshir. Bushair was a hypocrite who would recite poetry reviling the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) then he would attribute it to some of the Arabs. Then he would say: 'So-and-so said this and that [So-and-so said this and that].' So when the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) would hear that poetry, they would say: 'By Allah! No one but this filthy person said this poetry - or as the man said - and they would say: 'Ibn Al-Ubairiq said it.'\" He said: \"They were a poor and needy household during Jahiliyyah and Islam. The only food the people of Al-Madinah had was dates and barely. When a man was able to, he would import flour from Ash-Sham which he bought and kept for himself. As for his dependants, their only food was dates and barely. So an import arrived from Ash-Sham, and my uncle Rifa'ah bin Zaid bought a load of it, which he put in a storage area he had, where he kept his weapons - his shield and his sword. But it was taken from him from under the house. The storage was broken into and and the food and weapons were taken. In the morning, my uncle Rifa'ah came to me and said: 'O my nephew! We were robbed during the night, our storage was broken into, and our food and weapons are gone.'\" He said: \"They overheard us in the house, and questioned us, and someone said to us, 'We saw Banu Ubairiq cooking during the night, and it looked like they had some of your food.'\" He said: \"Banu Ubairiq were saying - while we were questioning them amidst their dwellings - 'By Allah! We do not think the one you are looking for is other than Labid bin Sahl, a man among us who is righteous and accepted Islam.' When Labid heard that, he brandished his sword and said: 'I stole? By Allah! You either prove this theft, or I take to you with this sword.' They said: 'Leave us O man! You are not the one who has it.' So we continued questioning in the dwellings until we had no doubt that they had taken it. So my uncle said to me: 'O my nephew! You should go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and tell him about that.'\" Qatadah said: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'A family among us are ill-mannered, and they conspired against my uncle Rifa'ah bin aid. They broken into his storage and took his weapons and his food. We want them to return our weapons, but we have no need for the food.' So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'I will decide about that.' So when Banu Ubairiq heard about that, they brought a man from among them named Usair bin 'Urwah to talk to him about that, and some people form their houses gathered and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Qatadah bin An-Nu'man and his uncle came came to a family among us who are a people of Islam and righteousness, accusing them of stealing without proof or confirmation.'\" Qatadah said: \"I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spoke to him, and he said: 'You went to a family among them known for their Islam and righteousness, and accused them of stealing without confirmation or proof.'\" He said: \"So I returned wishing that I had lost some of my wealth, and that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had not been spoke to about that. My uncle Rifa'ah came to me and said: 'O my nephew! What did you do?' So I told him what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me, so he said: 'It is from Allah, Whom we seek help.' It was not long before the Qur'an was revealed: 'Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men by that which Allah has shown you, so be not a pelader for the treacherous.' That is Banu Ubairiq. 'And seek forgiveness from Allah.' [That is] from what you said to Qatadah. 'Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide from Allah for He is with them up to His saying: 'Most Merciful.' That is: If you seek Allah's forgiveness then He will forgive you. 'And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself...' up to His saying: 'A manifest sin.' Their saying about Labid; 'Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you...' up to His saying: 'We shall give him a great reward.' (4:105-115)\" So when the Qur'an was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) brought the weapon and returned it to Rifa'ah. Qatadah said: \"When the weapon was brought to my uncle - and he was an elderly man with bad sight\" or \"an elderly weak man\" - Abu 'Eisa was in doubt - \"in Jahiliyyah, and I thought that he merely had entered into Islam (without real sincerity) but when I brought it to him, he said: 'O my nephew! It is for Allah's cause.' So I knew that his Islam was genuine. When the Qur'an was revealed, Bushair went with the idolaters, staying with Sulafah bint Sa'd bin Sumayyah. So Allah, Most High, revealed: Whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers' way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination. Verily Allah forgives not associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah, then he has indeed strayed away (4:115-116). \"When he went to stay with Sulafah, Hassan bin Thabit lampooned her with verses of poetry. So she took his saddle, put it on her head, then she left with it to cast into the valley. Then she said: 'You gave me the poetry of Hassan - you did not bring me any good.'\"</b>",

So 'Uthman said: 'A long time might pass upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) without anything being revealed to him, and then sometimes a Surah with numerous (Ayat) might be revealed. So when something was revealed, he would call for someone who could write, and say: \"Put these Ayat in the Surah which mentions this and that in it.\" When an Ayah was revealed, he would say: \"Put this Ayah in the Surah which mentions this and that in it.\" Now Al-Anfal was among the first of those revealed in Al-Madinah, and Bara'ah among the last of those revealed of the Qur'an, and its narrations (those of Bara'ah) resembled its narrations (those of Al-Anfal), so we thought that it was part of it.

The Quraish came out to help their caravan, so they met without an appointment as Allah the Mighty and Sublime, said. By my life, people consider the most honorable of battles of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to be that of Badr, but I would not have liked to attend it instead of my oath of allegiance on the night of Al-'Aqabah when we took a covenant for Islam. Afterwards, I did not stay behind from the Prophet (ﷺ) until the battle of Tabuk, and it was the last of the battles he fought. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) informed the people of the departure\" - and he mentioned the Hadith in its entirety, and said - \"So I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he was sitting in the Masjid, surrounded by the Muslims. He was beaming like the moon beams. When he was happy about a matter he would beam. So I came and said in front of him. He said: 'Receive glad tidings - O Ka'b bin Malik - of the best day you have seen since your mother bore you!' So I said: 'O Prophet of Allah! Is it from Allah or from you?' He said: 'From Allah.' Then he recited these Ayat: Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin, and the Ansar who followed him in the time of distress, after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated, but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful (9:117). [until he reached: Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful (9:118).] He said: \"And it was about us that (the following) was revealed as well: Have Taqwa of Allah, and be with those who are true (9:119).\" He said: \"O Prophet of Allah! Part of my repentance is to not say but the truth, and give up all of my wealth as charity for Allah and His Messenger.' So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Keep some of your wealth for yourself, for indeed that is better for you.' I said: 'So I will keep my share from Al-Khaibar.'\" He said: \"So after my acceptance of Islam, Allah did not grant me a greater favor than when I and my two companions told the truth to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we were not among the liars to be ruined like the others were ruined. Indeed I hope that Allah will not test anyone over telling the truth as he tested me.

I found the end of Surah Bara'ah with Khuzaimah bin Thabit: Verily, there has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is eager for you; for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful. But if they turn away, say: \"Allah is sufficient for me.

'Uthman said to the three Quraish men: 'In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the (recitation dialect of the) Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish for it was in their tongue.'

I heard Ubayy bin Ka'b saying: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say 'Musa stood to deliver a Khutbah to the children of Isra'il. He was asked: \"Who is the most knowledgeable among the people?\" He said: \"I am the most knowledgeable.\" So Allah admonished him, since he did not refer the knowledge back to Him. Allah revealed to him: \"A slave, among My slaves at the junction of the two seas, is more knowledgeable than you.\" So Musa said: \"O Lord! How can I meet him?\" He said to him: \"Carry a fish in a basket, wherever you lose the fish, then he is there.\" So he set off, and his boy set off with him - and he was Yusha' bin Nun. Musa put a fish in a basket, he and the boy set off walking, until when they reached a rock, Musa and his boy fell asleep. The fish was flopping around in the basket, falling into the sea.' He said: 'Allah held back the flow of water until it was like a tunnel, and the fish could glide. Musa and his boy were amazed. They set off the remainder of the day and the night, and Musa's companion forgot to inform him (of the escape of the fish). When Musa arose in the morning, he said to his boy: Bring us our morning meal; truly we have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey (18:62).' He said: 'He had not gotten tired until he passed the place which Allah had ordered him to go. He said: Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock? I indeed forgot the fish, none but Shaitan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a strange way (18:63). Musa said: That is what we have been seeking. So they went back, retracing their tracks (18:64). He said: 'So they began retracing their tracks.'\" Sufyan (one of the narrators) said: \"People claim that there is a spring of life at that rock, no dying person has its water poured over him, but he becomes alive, and the fish came in contact with some of it, so when the water dropped on it he became alive.\" \"He [the Prophet (ﷺ)] said: 'They retraced their tracks until they arrived at the rock to see a man covered in a garment. Musa greeted him, and he replied: Is there such a greeting in your land? He said: I am Musa. He said: Musa of the children of Isra'il? He said: Yes. He said: O Musa! Indeed you have some knowledge from Allah, which Allah taught you, which I have not been taught, and I have some knowledge from Allah, which Allah taught me, which you have not been taught.' So Musa said: May I follow you so that you may teach me something of the knowledge which you have been taught? (18:66) He said: Verily, you will not be able to have patience with me! And how can you have patience about a thing which you know not? He said: If Allah wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you at all (18:67-69). Al-Khadir said to him: Then if you follow me, ask me not about anything until I myself mention it to you (18:70). Musa said: Yes. So Musa and Al-Khadir set off walking along the shore of the sea. A boat was passing by them, and they spoke to them (the crew) asking them to let them get on board. They recognized Al-Khadir so they let the two of them ride without charge. Al-Khadir took one of the planks (in the boat) and removed it, so Musa said to him: These people gave us a ride free of charge, yet you sabotaged their boat so that its people will drown. Indeed you have done a dreadful thing (18:71). He said: Did I not tell you that you would not be able to have patience with me? (18:72). He said call me not to account for what I forgot, and be not hard upon me for my affair (18:73). Then they exited the boat, and while they were walking upon the shore, they saw a boy playing with two other boys. So Al-Khadir took him by his head, pulling it off with his hands, and he killed him. So Musa said to him: Have you killed an innocent person who killed no one! Verily you have done a horrendous thing (18:74). He said: Did I not tell you that you would not be able to have patience with me? (18:75) - he (the narrator) said: - \"This was more severe than the first one\" - He said: If I ask you about anything after this, you have received an excuse from me. So they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them for food but they refused to entertain them. There they found a wall on the verge of falling down (18:76 & 77). He (the narrator) said: - meaning leaning over - 'So Al-Khadir took his hand like this, so he set it up straight (18:77) so Musa said to him: We arrived at these people, they did not treat us as guests nor feed us. If you wished, surely you could have taken wages for it! He said: \"This is the parting between you and I. I will tell you the interpretation of (those) things over which you were not able to be patient (18:77 & 78).'\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'May Allah have mercy upon Musa! We wish that he would have had patience, so that we could have more knowledge about that two of them.' He said: 'So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The first time Musa had forgotten.' He said: 'And a sparrow came, until it perched on the edge of a boat, and pecked at the sea. So Al-Khadir said to him: My knowledge and your knowledge do not diminish anything from the knowledge of Allah, but like what this sparrow diminishes of the sea.' Sa'eed bin Jubair said: \"and he would\" - meaning Ibn 'Abbas - \"recite: 'And there was before them a king who would take every useful boat by force (18:79).' And he would recite: 'As for the boy, he was a disbeliever (18:80).'\"</b>",

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Either you produce proof, or you will receive the legal punishment on your back.'\" He said: \"Hilal said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! If one of us saw a man over his wife, should he go and search for witnesses?' The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on saying: 'Either you produce proof, or you will receive the legal punishment on your back.'\" He said: \"Hilal then said, 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth and Allah will reveal to you what will save my back from the legal punishment.' Then (the following) was revealed: And for those who accuse their wives, but have not witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah that he is one of those who speak the truth (24:6-9). He recited it until he reached: 'And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) was saying: 'Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so, will either of you repent?' Then the woman got up and took the oaths, and when she was about to take the fifth one; That the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth', the people stopped her and said to her: 'It will definitely bring about Allah's curse upon you (if you are guilty).'\" Ibn 'Abbas said 'So she hesitated, and recoiled so much so, that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But she said: 'I will not dishonor my family for the rest of their days.' The Prophet (ﷺ) then said: 'Watch her, if she delivers a child with eyes that appear to have Kuhl on them, big hips, and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma's child.' (Later) she gave birth to a child fitting that description. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'If it had not been settled in the Book of Allah [the Mighty and Sublime], I would punish her severely.'\"</b>",

        "hadithText": "Narrated 'Aishah:\n\"What was said about me had been said, and I myself was unaware of it, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up and addressed the people. He recited the Tashahhud and after praising and expressing gratitude to Allah, as He deserved, he said: 'To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her at all. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.' Sa'd bin Mu'adh [may Allah be pleased with him] got up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop their heads off!' Then a man from Al-Khazraj, to whom the mother of Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sa'd): 'You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from Al-Aws, you would not like to chop their heads.' It was probable that some evil would take place between Aws and Khazraj in the Masjid while I was unaware of that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs, and Umm Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Umm Mistah stumbled and said: 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said to her, 'O mother! Why do you abuse your son?' On that Umm Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said: 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said to her: 'O mother! Why do you abuse your son?' She stumbled for the third time and said: 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said to her: 'O mother! Why do you abuse your son?' Upon that she said: 'By Allah! I do not abuse him except because of you.' I asked her: 'Concerning what of my affairs?' So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said: 'Has this really happened?' She replied: 'Yes, by Allah!' I returned to my house, so astonished, that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick and said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) 'Send me to my father's house.' So he sent a servant with me, and when I entered the house, I found Umm Ruman downstairs, while Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked: 'What has brought you, O daughter?' She said: \"I informed her and mentioned the whole story to her, but she did not feel as I did about it. She said: 'O my daughter! Do not worry much about this matter, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives, but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.' But she did not feel the same about it as I did. I asked her: 'Does my father know about it?' She said 'Yes.' I asked: 'Does the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) know about it too?' She said 'Yes, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) also knows about it.' Tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs, heard my voice, and came down asking my mother: 'What is the matter with her?' She said: 'She has heard what has been said about her.' On that Abu Bakr wept and said: 'I beseech you, by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home.' I went back to my home, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had come to my house asking my maid-servant about me. The maid-servant said: 'By Allah! I do not know of any fault or defect in her character except that she sleeps and lets the sheep enter and eat her dough.' On that, some of the Prophet's Companions spoke harshly to her and said: 'Tell the truth to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' Finally, they told her of the slander and she said: 'Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what a goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.' Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said: 'Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.' Later, that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. Then the next morning, my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me, after he performed the 'Asr prayer. He came to me and while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. The Prophet (ﷺ) said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah and said: 'Now then, O 'Aishah! If you have committed a bad deed, or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah, as Allah accepts the repentance from His worshipers.' An Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said to the Prophet (ﷺ): 'Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady?' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to reply to him. My father said: 'What should I say?' Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said: 'What should I say?' When my parents did not reply to the Prophet (ﷺ), I said the Tashahhud, praised and glorified Allah as His due, and I said: 'Then, by Allah! If I were to tell you that I have not done (this) and Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part, because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it (as truth); and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin, and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say: 'She has confessed her guilt.' By Allah! I do not see a suitable example for me and you except the example of - and I could not remember Ya'qbus name - Yusuf's father when he said: So patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that which you describe (12:18). She said: \"It was at that time that Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and we remained silent. Then the Revelation was over, and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was wiping (the sweat) from his forehead, and saying: 'Have the good tidings O 'Aishah! Allah has revealed your innocence.' At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me: 'Get up and go to him.' I said: 'By Allah, I will not do it,and will not thank him nor either of you, but I will thank Allah, Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard (this story) but neither of you have denied it, nor have you changed it (to defend me).'\" 'Aishah used to say: \"But as regards to Zainab bint Jahsh, Allah protected her because of her piety. She did not say anything except good (about me). But her sister, Hamnah was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite 'Abdullah bin Ubayy [bin Salul] and [it is he who] used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamnah who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor for Mistah at all. Then Allah, Most High, revealed this Ayah: 'Let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth' [until the end of the Ayah] referring to Abu Bakr: 'to give their kinsmen, the poor, and those who left their homes for Allah's Cause.' - meaning Mistah - up to His saying: Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (24:22).' On that, Abu Bakr said: 'Yes, by Allah! O our Lord! We wish that You forgive us.' So he returned to what he had been doing.\"</b>",

Abu Bakr mentioned that to them, and they said: 'Make a wager between us and you; if we win, we shall get this and that, and if you win, you shall get this or that.' He made the term five years, but they (the Romans) were not victorious. They mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: \"Why did you not make it less (than)\" - He (one of the narrators said): I think he said: \"ten?\" He said: Sa'eed said: \"Al-Bid' is what is less than then\" - he said: \"Afterwards the Romans have been victorious.\" He said: \"That is what Allah Most High said: 'Alif Lam Mim.

In the nearest land, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious in Bid' years (30:1-4).' - on the day that these Ayat were revealed, the Persians had defeated the Romans, and the Muslims had wanted the Romans to be victorious over them, because they were the people of the Book. So Allah said about that: 'And on that day, the believers will rejoice - with the help of Allah. He helps whom He wills, and He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful (30:4 & 5). The Quraish wanted the Persians to be victorious since they were not people of the Book, nor did they believe in the Resurrection. So when Allah revealed these Ayat, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, went out, proclaiming throughout Makkah: 'Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated. In the nearest land, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious, in Bid' years (30:1-4).' Some of the Quraish said: 'Then this is (a bet) between us and you. Your companion claims that the Romans will defeat the Persians in Bid' years, so why have have a bet on that between us and you?' Abu Bakr said: 'Yes.' This was before betting has been forbidden. So Abu Bakr and the idolaters made a bet, and they said to Abu Bakr: 'What do you think - Bid' means something between three and nine years, so let us agree on the middle.' So they agreed on six years; Then six years passed without the Romans being victorious. The idolaters took what they won in the bet from Abu Bakr. When the seventh year came and the Romans were finally victorious over the Persians, the Muslims rebuked Abu Bakr for agreeing to six years. He said: 'Because Allah said: 'In Bid' years.' At that time, many people became Muslims.\"</b>",
