Then he said: 'This is the master of the men and jinn, this is the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds. Allah will raise him as a mercy to the men and jinn.' So some of the older people from the Quraish said: 'What do you know?' He said: 'When you people came along from the road, not a rock nor a tree was left, except that it prostrated, and they do not prostrate except for a Prophet. And I can recognize him by the seal of the Prophethood which is below his shoulder blade, like an apple.' Then he went back, and made them some food, and when he brought it to them, he [the Prophet (ﷺ)] was tending to the camels. So he said: 'Send for him.' So he came, and there was a cloud over him that was shading him. When he came close to the people, he found that they had beaten him to the tree's shade. So when he sat down, the shade of the tree leaned towards him. He (the monk) said: 'Look at the shade of the tree leaning towards him.'\" He said: \"So while he was standing over them, telling them not to take him to Rome with him - because if the Romans were to see him, they would recognize him by his description, and they would kill him - he turned, and there were seven people who had come from Rome. So he faced them and said: 'Why have you come?' They said: 'We came because this Prophet is going to appear during this month, and there isn't a road left except that people have been sent to it, and we have been informed of him, and we have been send to this road of yours.' So he said: 'Is there anyone better than you behind you?' They said: 'We only have news of him from this road of yours.' He said: 'Do you think that if there is a matter which Allah wishes to bring about, there is anyone among the people who can turn it away?' They said: 'No.'\" He said: \"So they gave him their pledge, and they stayed with him. And he said: 'I ask you by Allah, which of you is his guardian?' They said: 'Abu Talib.'

He was big-boned and broad shouldered (Al-Katad), his body hair was well-placed, and he had a Masrubah, his hands and feet were thick (Shathn). When he walked he walked briskly (Taqalla'), he leaned forward as if he was walking on a decline (Sabab). And if he turned his head, his body turned as well, between his two shoulders was the seal of Prophethood, and he was the seal of the Prophets. He was the most generous of people [in hand, and the most big-hearted of them] in breast. He was the most truthful of people in speech, the softest of them in nature, and the most noble of them in his relations ('Ishrah). Whoever saw him for the first time (Badihah) would fear him, and whoever got to know him, loved him.

And as for Al-Mushrab, then it is the one who has some redness to his whiteness. And Al-Ad'aj: is extreme darkness of the eyes. And Al-Ahdab means long eye-lashes. And Al-Katad: means the place where the shoulders meet, and it is Al-Kahil. And Al-Masrubah is the faint hair which appears as a line from the chest to the navel. And Ash-Shathn is thick appendages on the hands and feet. And At-Taqallu' is to walk with force. And As-Sabab: is a decline. We say: 'We descended from declines and a decline.' And his statement: 'Jalilul Mashash: means the tips of his shoulders. And Al-'Ishrah is companionship. And Al-'Ashir is the companion. And Al-Badihah is an unexpected occurance.
