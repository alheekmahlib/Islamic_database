Allah will gather the people, the first and the last, on one level ground where they will (all) be able to hear a caller, and all of them will be visible, and the sun will be brought near such that the people will suffer distress and trouble that they cannot tolerate nor bear. Then some people will say: \"Don't you see the state you have reached? Why don't you look for a person who can intercede for you with your Lord? \" Some of them will say to others: \" You should go to Adam.\" So they will go to Adam and say, \"You are the father of all mankind, Allah created you with His Own Hands, and breathed into you from His spirit (which He creted for you) and ordered the angels to prostrate for you. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see what has happened to us? Don't you see the state we have reached?\" On that Adam will reply, \"Today my Lord has become angry such that He has never before been angry, and will never be thereafter. He forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed(Him), Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to somebody else; Go to Nuh.\" They will go to Nuh and say: \"O Nuh! You are the first among the Messengers to the people of the earth, and Allah named you a thankful slave. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see what has happened to us? Don't you see the state we have reached?\" Nuh will say to them : \"Today my Lord has become angry as He has never before been angry, and will never be thereafter.

You are the Messenger of Allah and His Word which He placed into Mariam, and a Spirit from Him, and you spoke to the people in the cradle. Intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see what has happened to us?\" Then 'Eisa will say: \"Today my Lord has become angry as He has never before been angry and will never be thereafter.\" He will not mention a sin, but will say: \"Myself!

My Ummah!\" He will say: \"O Muhammad! Let those of your Ummah who have no accounts enter the gate on the right among the gates of Paradise, and they shall share in the gates other than that with the people.'\" Then he (s.a.w) said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul!

Until he passed by a large multitude. (The Prophet (s.a.w)said: ) I said: 'Who is this?' It was said: 'Musa and his people. But raise your head and look.' There was a large multitude that covered the horizon, from one side to the other. It was said: 'These people are your Ummah, and there are seventy thousand besides these from your Ummah that shall enter Paradise without a reckoning.' So he went inside, and they did not question him, and he gave no explanation to them. (Some of them) said: 'We are them.' Others said: 'They are the children who were born upon the Fitrah and Islam.' So the Prophet (s.a.w) came out and said: 'They are those who do not get themselves cauterized, nor seek Ruqyah, nor read omens, and upon their Lord they rely.' So 'Ukashah bin Mihsan stood and said: 'Am I among them O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Yes.' Then another one stood up and said: 'Am I among them?'

Then Abul-Qasim (s.a.w) passed, and he smiled when he saw me, and said: 'Abu Hurairah?' I said: 'I am here O  Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Come along.' He continued and I followed him, he entered his house, so I sought permission to enter, and he permitted me. He found a bowl of milk and said: 'Where did this milk come from?' It was said: 'It was a gift to us from so – and – so.' So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'O Abu Hurairah' I said: 'I am here O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Go to the people of As-Suffah to invite them.' - Now, they were the guests of the people of Islam, they had nothing of people nor wealth to rely upon. Whenever some charity was brought to him, he would send it to them without using any of it. And when a gift was given to him (s.a.w), he would send for them to participate and share with him in it. I became upset about that, and I said (to myself): 'What good will this bowl be among the people of As-Suffah and I am the one bringing it to them?' Then he ordered me to circulate it among them (So I wondered) what of it would reach me from it, and I hoped that I would get from it what would satisfy me. But I would certainly not neglect to obey Allah and obey His Messenger, so I went to them and invited them. When they entered upon him they sat down. He said: 'Abu Hurairah, take the bowl and give it to them.' So I gave it to a man who drank his fill, then he gave it to another one, until it ended up with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w), and all of the people had drank their fill. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) took the bowl, put it on his hand,then raised his head. He smiled and said: 'Abu Hurairah, drink.' So I drank, then he said: 'Drink.' I kept drinking and he kept on saying, 'Drink.' Then I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth! I have no more space for it.' So he took the bowl and praised Allah, mentioned His Name and drank.'” (Sahih)</b>",

When we are with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) we remember the Fire and Paradise as if we are looking at them with the naked eye. But when we return we busy ourselves with our wives and livelihood and we forget so much.” He(Abu Bakr) said: “By Allah! The same thing happens to me. Let us go to the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w).” (Hanzalah said:) “So he went.\" When the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) saw him, he said: “What is wrong with you O Hanzalah?” He said: “Hanzalah has become a hypocrite O Messenger of Allah! When we are with you we remember the Fire and Paradise as if we can see them with the naked eye. But when we return we are busy with our wives and livelihood, and we forget so much.” He said: “So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'If you were to abide in the state that you are in when you are with me, then the Angels would shake hands with you in your  gatherings, and upon your bedding, and in your paths.
