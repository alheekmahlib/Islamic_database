Muhammad bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari is trustworthy, and his father is trustworthy. 'Ali bin Zaid (narrators in the chain) is truthful, but he sometimes narrates something in Marfu' form when others narrate it in Mawquf form. I heard Muhammad bin Bash-shar saying: \"Abu Al-Walid said: 'Shu'bah said: 'Ali bin Zaid narrated to us - and he would narrated Marfu' form - and we do not know any narration of Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab from Anas except this Hadith in its entirety.\r\n'Abbad [bin Maisarah] Al-Minqari reported this Hadith from 'Ali bin Zaid from Anas, and he did not mention \"from Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab\" in it.\r\n[Abu 'Eisa said:] I conferred with Muhammad bin Isma'il about it, but he did not know it, nor did he know of Sa'eed bin Al-Musayyab reporting this Hadith, or any other Hadith from Anas bin Malik. Anas bin Malik died during the year ninety-three, and Sa'eed Al-Musayyab died two years after him, in the year ninety-five.",
