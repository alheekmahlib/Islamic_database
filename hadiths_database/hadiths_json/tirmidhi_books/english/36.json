So he said:\"What brought you O Abu Bakr?\" He said: \"I came to meet the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) and to look at his face, and to make sure he was safe. It was not long before 'Umar came. He said: \"What has brought you O 'Umar ?\" He said: \"Hunger  O  Messenger of Allah!\"He said: \"I also experienced some of that\" So they went to the home of Abu Al-Haitham At-Taiyyihan Al-Ansari. He was a man with many date-palms and sheep, but he had no servants so they did not find him there. They said to his wife: \"Where is your companion?\" She said: \"He has gone to fetch us some good water.\" It was not long before Abu Al-Haitham came along hauling to a large water-skin which he put down. Then he came to hug the Prophet (s.a.w) and uttered that his father and mother should be ransomed for him. Then he went to grove of his and he spread out a mat for them. Then he went to a date-palm and returned with a cluster of dates which he put down. The prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Why don't you select some ripe dates for us?\" He said:  \"O Messenger of Allah(s.a.w)! I wanted you to select from the ripe dates and the unripe dates.\" So they ate and they drank from that water. The Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! This is among the favors which you shall be asked about on the Day of Judgement. Cool shade, tasty ripe dates, and cool water.\" Abu Al-Haitham left to prepare some food for them. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Do not slaughter one with milk.\" So he Slaughtered a small female or male goat and brought it to them so they could eat it. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Do you have any servants?\" He said: \"No.\" So he said: \"Then if we get some captives we shall bring them for you.\" So (later) the Prophet (s.a.w) came with 2 males, there was no third among them and he brought them to Abu Al-Haitham. The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Choose from them.\" He said: \"O Prophet of Allah! Choose for me.\" So the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Indeed the one consulted is entrusted. Take this one for I have seen him praying, and encourage him to do well.\" So Abu Al-Haitham went to his wife and informed her of what the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said. So his wife said: \"You will not fulfill what the Prophet (s.a.w) said until you have freed him.\" So he said: \"He is free.\" So the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Indeed Allah has not send a Prophet nor made a Khalifah except that he has two groups of supporters, group ordering him to do good, and prohibiting him from evil and a group that never ceases spoiling his affairs.

        "hadithText": "Al-Walid bin Abi Al-Wald abu 'Utthman Al-Mada'ini narrated that 'Uqbah bin Muslim narrated to him, that shufaiy Al-Asbahi narrated that he entered Al-Madinah and saw a man around whom the people had gathered. He asked:\n\" Who is this?\" They said: \"Abu Hurairah.\"  (He said):So I got close to him until I was sitting in front of him as he was narrating to the people. When he was silent and alone, I said to him: \" I ask youabsolute truth if you would narrate to me a Hadith which you heard from the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w), That you understand and know.\"\nSo Abu Hurairah said: \"You want me to narrate a Hadith to you which the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) narrated to me that I understand and know.\" Then Abu Hurairah began sobbing profusely. We sat for a while, then he recovered and said: \"I shall narrate to you a Hadith which the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) narrated in this House, while there was no one with us other than he and I.\" \nThen, again, Abu Hurairah began sobbing severely. Then he recovered, and wiped his face, and said: \"you want me to narrate to you a Hadith which the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) narrated while he and I were sitting in this House, and no one was with us but he and I.\" Then Abu Hurairah began sobbing severely. Then he bent, falling on his face, so I supported him for a long time. Then he recovered and said: \"The Messenger of Allah narrated to me that on the Day of Judgement, Allah, Most High, will descend to His slaves t judge between them. Every nation shall be kneeling. The first of those who will be called before him will be a man who memorized the Qur'an, and a man who was killed in Allah's cause, and a wealthy man. Allah will say to the reciter: 'Did I not teach you what I revealed to My Messenger?\" He says: 'Of course O Lord!' He says: 'Then what did you do with what you learned?' He said: 'I would stand (in prayer reciting) with it during all hours of the night and all hours of the day.' Then Allah would say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say: 'You have lied.'Allah will say to him: 'Rather, you wanted it to be said that so-and-so is a reciter. And that was said.' The person with the wealth will be brought, and Allah will say to him: 'Was I not so generous with you, such that I did not leave you having any need from anyone?' He will say: 'Of course O Lord!' He says: 'Then what did you do with what I gave to you?' He says: 'I would nurture the ties of kinship and give charity.' Then Allah will say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say to him: 'You have lied.' Allah, Most High, will say: 'Rather, you wanted it to be said that so-and-so is so generous, and that was said.' Then the one who was killed in Allah's cause shall be brought, and Allah will say to him : 'For what were you killed?' So he says: 'I was commanded to fight in Your cause ,so I fought until I was killed.' Allah [Most High] will say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say to him: 'You have lied.' Allah [Most High] will say: 'Rather, you wanted it be said that so-and-so is brave, and that was said.' \n\"Then the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w)hit me on my knees and said: 'O Abu Hurairah! These first three are the creatures of Allah with whom the fire will be enflamed on the Day of Judgement.'\"\nAl-Walid Abu 'Uthman Al-Mada'ini said: \"So 'Uqbah bin Muslim informed me that Shaufaiy, is the one who entered upon Mu'awiyah to inform him about this.\" Abu Uthman said: 'This has been done with these people, then how about with those who remain among the people?\" Then Mu'awiyah begin weeping so intensely, that we thought that he will kill himself with excessive weeping. We said: \"This man came to us to cause evil.\" Then Mu'awiyah recovered, wiped off his face and said: \"Allah and His Messenger told the truth: Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, then we shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they shall have no diminution therein. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter Fire, and vain are the deeds they did therein. And of no effect is that which they used to do.\"</b>",
