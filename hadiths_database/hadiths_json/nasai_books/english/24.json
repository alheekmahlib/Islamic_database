Aishah said: 'What a bad thing you said, O son of my brother! If this Ayah was as you have interpreted it, there would be no sin on a person if he did not go between them. But it was revealed concering the Ansar. Before they accepted Islam, they sued to enter Ihram for the false goddess Manat whom they used to worship at Al-Mushallal. Whoever enter Ihram for her would refrain from going between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. When they asked the Messenger of Allah about that, Allah, the Might and Sublime, revealed: 'Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwah (Two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or Urmrah (Pilgrimage) of the House (the Kabah at Makkah) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). Then the Messenger of Allah enjoined going between them so no one has the right to refrain from going between them.'\"</b>",

The Messenger of Allah entered Ihram for 'Umrah frist, them for Hajj, and the people also benefited by entering Ihram for 'Umrah first, then for Hajj. Some of the people brought the Hadi and carried it along with them, and other s did not. When the Messenger of Allah came to Makkah, he said to the people: 'Whoever among you has brought a Hadi, nothing is permissible for him that became forbidden when he entered Ihram, until he has finished his Hajj, Whoever did not find a Hadi, let him fast for three days during the Hajj, and for seven when he returns to his family, the Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf when he came to Makkah and touched the corner (where the Black Stone is) first of all, then he walked rapidly during the first three of the seven circles, and walked daring the last four. After he finished circumambulating the House he prayed two Rak'ahs at Maqam Ibrahim. Then he went to As-Safa and walked seven rounds between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. And he did not do any action that was forbidden because of Ihram until he had completed his Hajj and slaughtered his Hadi on the Day of sacrifice. Then he hastened onward (toard Makkah) and circumambulated the House. Then everything that had been forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. And those who had brought the Hadi with them did the same as the Messenger of Allah did.</b>",
