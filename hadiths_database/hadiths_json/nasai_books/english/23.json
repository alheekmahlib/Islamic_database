He said: 'What I fear most for you after I am gone is the (worldly) delights that will come to you.' And he spoke of this world and its attractions. A man said: 'Can good bring forth evil? 'The Messenger of Allah remained silent and it was said to him (that man): 'What is the matter with you? You speak to the Messenger of Allah when he does not speak to you? We noticed that he was receiving Revelation. Then he recovered and wiped off his sweat and said: I know what the questioner meant: he means that good never brings forth evil. But some of that which grows in the spring kills the animals or makes them sick, unless they eat Al-Khadir (kind of plant): if they eat their fill or it then turn to face the sun and then defecate and urinate and start to graze again. This wealth is fresh and sweet. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to a Muslim from which he gives to orphans, the poor and wayfarers. The one who takes it unlawfully is like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and who eats but is never satisfied, and it will be a witness against him on the Day of  Resurrection.\"'</b>",

The Messenger of Allah said: 'Among the offspring of this man will be some people who will recite the Qur'an but it will not go any further than their throats.

Most of them, may all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The face of the Messenger of Allah changed when he saw them in poverty. He went in (to his house) then he came out and ordered Bilah to call the Adhan and then the Iqamah. He (the Prophet) prayed, tjem je addressed te,, (reciting the Verses): 'O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him(Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women: and fear Allah through Whom you demand (your mutual right), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship).  Surely, Allah is Ever and All-Watcher over you.' [1] and: 'Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow,' [2] Then they gave in charity, some giving a Dinar, others a Dirham, or a garment, or a Sa' of wheat or, a Sa' of dates, until he said: 'Even half a date.' A man from among the Ansar came with a bag of money which his hands could hardly lift. The people followed one another (in giving charity) until I saw two heaps of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allah shining like gold (with joy). The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever sets a good precedent in Islam, he will have the reward for that, and the reward of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever sets an evil precedent in Islam, he will have a burden of sin for that, and the burden of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.\"'</b>",

My father sent me to a group of them to bring their Sadaqah to him. I set out and came to an old man who was called Sa'r. I said: My father has sent me to collect the Sadaqah of your sheep. 'He said: O son of my brother, how will you decode what you want to take?' I said\" 'We choose, and we even measure the sheep's udders.' He said: O son of my brother, I tell you that I was in one of these mountain passes at the time of the Messenger of Allah with some sheep of mine. Two men came on a camel and said: We are the messengers of the Messengers of Allah, we come to take the Sadaqah of your sheep. I said: What do I have to give? They said: A sheep. So I went to a sheep that I knew was filled with milk and was fat, and brought it out to them. He said: This is a Shafi - a sheep that has a child or is pregnant - and the Messenger of Allah forbade us to take a Shafi'. So I went to a Mu'tat she-goat - a Mutat is one that has not given birth before, but has reached the age where it could produce young- and brought it out to them. They said: We will take it. So I lifted it up to them, and they took it with them on their camel and left.\"' (Daif)</b>",

In the event that a person does not have a camel of the age specified according to the Hiaqah regulations, then if a person owes a Jadhah as Sadaqah  but he does not have  a Jadhah, then a Hiqqah should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams, If he owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah and he does not have Hiqqah but he has a Jadhah, then if should be accepted from him, and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams, or two sheep if they are available. If a person owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Labun, it should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah but he only has a Hiqaah, then it should be accepted from him and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams, or two sheep. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah but he only has a Bint Makhad, then it should be accepted from him, and he should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Makhad as Sadaqah but he only has a Bint Labun, a male; it should be accepted from him, and he does not have to give anything else along with it. If a person has only four camels he does not have to give anything unless their owner wants to. With regard to the Sadaqah on grazing sheep, if there are forty, then one sheep is due upon them, up to one hundred and twenty. If there is one more, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more, then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there are more than that, then for every hundred, one sheep is due. No feeble, defective or male sheep should be taken as Sadaqah unless the Zakah collector wishes. Do not combine separate flocks or separate combined flocks for fear of Sadaqah. Each partner (who has a share in a combined flock) should pay the Sadaqah in proportion to his shares. If a man's flock is one less than forty sheep, then nothing is due from them, unless their owner wishes. With regard to silver, one-quarter of one-tenth, and if there are only one hundred and ninety Dirhams, no Zakah is due unless the owner wishes.\"</b>",
