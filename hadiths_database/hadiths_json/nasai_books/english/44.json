'Aishah, who liked her and wanted to help her, said: 'Go back to your masters and if they agree to let me pay the whole sum and that your loyalty will be to me, I will do it.' So Barirah went to her masters and suggested that to them, but they refused and said: 'if she wants to seek reward (with Allah) by freeing you, let her do so, but (you loyalty) will be to us, 'Aishah told the Messenger of Allah about that and he said: 'Do not let that stop you. Buy her and set her free, and loyalty belongs to the one who sets the slave free.; so she did that, then the Messenger of Allah stood up before the people, praised and glorified Allah, then said: 'What is the matter with people who stipulate conditions that are not in the Book of Allah? Whoever stipulates conditions that are not in even if there are a hundred conditions? The decree of Allah takes priority, and the conditions of Allah binding.

Marwan sent my letter to Mu'awiyah, and Mu'awiyah wrote to Marwan (saying): 'Neither you nor Usaid are in a position to tell me what to do, rather I am the one who tells you what to do because I am superior in rank to you, so do what I tell you.'
