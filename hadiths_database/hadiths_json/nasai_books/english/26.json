She sent word to him telling him that her maternal aunt had told her to do that. Fatimah bint Qais said that she had been married to Abu 'Amr bin Hafs, and when the Messenger of Allah appointed 'Ali bin Abi Talib as governor of Yemen, he went out with him and sent word to her that she was divorced with the third Talaq.  He told Al-Harith bin Hisham and 'Ayyash bin Abi Rai'ah to spend on her.  She sent word to Al-Harith and 'Ayyash asking them what her husband had told them to spend on her, and they said: 'By Allah, she has no right to any maintenance from us, unless she is pregnant, and she cannot come into our home without our permission.' She said that she came to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that, and he stated that they were correct. Fatimah said: 'Where should I move to, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Move to the home of Ibn Umm Maktum, the blind man whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, named in His Book.' Fatimah said: 'So I observed my 'Iddah there.  He was a man who has lost his sight, so I used to take off my garments in his house, until the Messenger of Allah married me to Usamah bin Zaid.'

Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'Let them sit around the dish of food in groups of ten, one after the other, and let each person eat from what is closest to him.' They ate until they were full, then one group went out and another group came in. He said to me: 'O Anas, clear it away.' So I cleared it away, and I do not know whether there was more when I cleared it away, or when I put it down.\"</b>",

He said: 'The Messenger of Allah saw traces of yellow perfume on me and he said: 'What is this for?' I said: 'I have married a woman from among the Ansar.' He said: 'Give a Walimah (wedding feast) even if it is with one sheep.'\"</b>",
