I greeted him with the salutation of peace, so he said: 'O Fadl!”'I said: 'Doubly at your service, O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Wrap my head firmly with this band!' I acted accordingly, then he sat and placed the palm of his hand on my shoulder. Then he stood up and entered the mosque.” (This tradition is part of a longer story.)</b>",

        "comments": "Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam fastened the band because of a headache. Some 'ulama have translated it as a turban instead of a band. It is evident that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam wore different coloured turbans. The proof of the yellow turban is taken from this hadith. The incident which Imaam Tirmidhi has referred to has been mentioned in detail in the kittab 'Majma'-uz Zawaa-id'. Sayyidina Fadl Radiyallahu 'Anhu says: I attended the noble assembly of Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam. I noticed that Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam had a fever and a band was fastened around his mubaarak head. Rasulullah Sallallhu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'Hold my hand'. I held his hand and (we) entered the masjid. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam sat on the mimbar, and said: 'Call the people'. I went to gather the people. After reciting the hamd and thanaa (thanks and praises to Allah) he addressed them on this subject: 'The time has come near when I shall leave you. Whomsoever I had hit on the back may take revenge. Whomsoever I have dishonoured or disgraced wrongfully, let him take revenge by dishonouring me. Let no person fear that if he takes revenge I shall hate him, for it is not my nature to do so, nor is it appropriate for me to do so. Remember, that person shall be very dear to me who avenges himself, or forgives me, so that I may meet my creator in happiness and without fear. I will not consider it sufficient to announce this once only, but shall announce it again\". Thereafter he descended from the mimbar. After performing the zuhr salaah, he again ascended the mimbar and made the same announcement. He also repeated about the hatred as mentioned above, and added that if anyone owe's anything, let him pay it because the disgrace of this world is much less than the disgrace of the hereafter. A person stood up and said: \"Oh Rasulullah, you owe me three Dirhams'. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallain said: 'I will not refute someone's claim, nor will I make him swear an oath, but I would like to ask you, how and when was it taken?' He replied: 'A beggar once came to you. You asked me to give him three Dirhams'. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam told Sayyidina Fadl Radiyallahu 'Anhu to pay him the three Dirhams. Thereafter another person got up and said: 'I owe the Baytul Maal (Public Treasury) three Dirhams, which I cheated and wrongfully took from it'. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam asked: 'Why did you cheat?' He replied: 'At that time I was in need and very desperate'. Sayyidina Rasuluilah Saliallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam asked Sayydina Fadl Radiyallahu 'Anhu to collect the money from him. Thereafter Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallamn announced : 'If anyone fears one's habits, let him ask for a du'aa (because the time for departure is near). A person got up and said. 'Oh Rasulullah, I am a liar, a munaafiq (hypocrite) and I sleep allot. 'Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam made du'aa for him, 'Oh Allah grant him truthfulness, a strong (and complete) imaan (faith), and cure from the illness of sleeping (a lot)'. After that another person stood up and said: 'Oh Rasulullah, I am a liar, a munaafiq and there is no sin which I have not committed'. Sayyidina 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu warned him that he was openly declaring his sins. Sayyidina Rasulullah Saliallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'O 'Umar, be calm, the disgrace of the world is lighter and better than the disgrace of the hereafter'. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallarn made du'aa for that person, 'Oh Allah, grant him truthfulness and a strong imaan, and make his life a better one'. Thereafter Sayyidina 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu got up and said something to the congregation. In reply to which Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: Umar is with me and I am with 'Umar. After me 'Umar will remain on the truth wherever he goes'. In another hadith it is stated that a person got up and said: 'O Rasulullah, I am a coward and have the sickness of sleeping allot'. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam also made dua for him Sayydina Fadl Radiyallahu 'Anhu says: 'We saw thereafter, that there was no person braver than him'. After this Sayydina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam went to the room of Sayyiditina Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha and repeated to the womenfolk what he had said to the menfolk. One Sahaabiyyah got up and said: 'Oh Rasulullah, I am helpless from my tongue'. Sayydina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam made dua for her'. Majma-uz-Zawaa-id.",
