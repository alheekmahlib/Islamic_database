        "hadithText": "'Ai'sha said:\n\"Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) told his wives a story one night, and one of them said: “It sounds like a fable of Khurafa!” He said: “Do you know what that means? Khurafa was a man from [the Yemenite tribe of] 'Udhra. The jinn captured him in the pagan era [al-jahiliyya], so he stayed with them for a long time, then they returned him to his people. He used to tell the people about the marvels that he saw among them, so the people said: ‘The fable of Khurafa.'”</b>",

        "comments": "It is possible that the person had another name, and because the people took his stories to be fables and amusing, he became famously known as Khuraafah. In the time of the Jaahiliyyah, exorcism was widespread. The jinns troubled humans very much, they took them away, spoke to them, had intercourse with women, etc. of which there are many famous incidents. After the appearance of Islam their strength subsided, till some people began to believe that jinns existed before, and now they do not exist. The fact is that they do exist, but do not have the power they possessed previously. At the time of the birth of Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam the events that took place, the wailing, trouble, etc. that the jinns experienced is a testimony to this. In the Sahih Bukhari a narration of Sayyidina Umar radiyallahu anhu is mentioned, where he states about the poetry of a beloved woman of a magician, named Janiyah, on grief, disgrace and the misfortune of the jinns. Imaam Suyuti has mentioned many incidents of this nature in his book â€˜Khasaa-is-Kubraâ€™.",
