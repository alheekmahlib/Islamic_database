The 'ulama have written that water is mentioned because there were not enough dates, and without water the stomach could not be filled. First a few dates were eaten, thereafter an amount of water was drunk to fill the stomach. In another hadith it is stated 'Two full months would pass and the hilaal for the third month would be observed, and no circumstances warranted that a fire be lit in the houses of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam for cooking'. In a hadith it is stated: 'One month passed, then another month passed, there was no such occasion where a fire was lit in any of the houses of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam'. 'Urwah Radiyallahu 'Anhu asked his aunt Sayyiditina 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha, 'O Aunt, on what did you sustain yourself? She replied: 'Dates and water. There were a few neighbours of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam from among the Ansaar who owned some animals that gave milk. If one of them sent some milk as a present, then we too would partake of it'. In a hadith it is stated: 'Once for one and half months continuously, no fire was lit in the house of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam for illumination or other purposes'. Fire for illumination means that a lamp or candle did not burn. Jam'ul Wasaa'il.<br><br>In a hadith it is narrated that Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anbu once presented a leg of a goat. It was night time and Sayyiditina 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha began cutting it into pieces in the dark. Someone said.. 'There is no lamp in the house'. She began to say: 'If there was oil for a lamp, would it not have been used for cooking?' The 'ulama have written that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam preferred this way for himself and his family, although the keys of treasures were presented to him. The ummah thereafter split into four groups. One is that group that did not take interest in the material aspects of the world, nor did the world go towards them, like Sayyidina Abubakr Siddiqe Radiyallahu 'Anhu. The second group are those who did not take interest in worldly things, but the world took interest in them, like Sayyidina 'Umar Faaruq Radiyallahu 'Anhu. The third group are those who took interest in the material world, and the world also took interest in them, like the Banu Umayyah kings excluding 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'aziz Radiyallahu 'Anhu. The fourth group are those who went seeking for the material world, but the world did not turn towards them, like the one's whom Allah Ta'aala has made poor, and the love for the world has settled in their hearts. - Munaawi.",

        "comments": "It was a custom among the people of Madinah that they fastened stones onto their stomachs when they experienced severe pangs of hunger. This was done so that they do not feel weak while walking and that wind might not build up in the stomach. Some of the 'ulama are of the opinion that this is a special type of stone of Madinah known as mishba'ah. Allah Ta'aala has put this peculiarity in this stone that if it is worn it will cool the pangs of hunger. The first explanation is clearer, because even today this is done, that when severe hunger is experienced a cloth is tightly fastened around the stomach, which is beneficial for weakness and soothes the pangs of hunger. Some 'ulama say it is possible that wind collects in an empty stomach, and by fastening a stone or a heavy object, it gives relief from hunger. Some of the 'ulama have written that when the stomach is altogether empty, it is feared that the intestines will come down, especially when walking, and by fastening the stomach this fear does not remain. Also when the stomach becomes altogether empty, the back also becomes bent. It is possible that worms may appear. An objection may occur that in many ahaadith it is stated Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam fasted for many days continuously, and when the Sahaabah intended to do so, Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam forbade them to do so, and said: 'This is specially for me, that I can fast for many days without eating, because Allah Ta'aala feeds me and gives me to drink'. How is this eating and drinking? This is on its place, but we find that by outwardly not eating, hunger did not have an effect on Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. In this case the necessity to fasten a stone on the stomach does not remain. Since there are many ahaadith on the fasting of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, for this reason some of the 'ulama have according to the principles and rules of hadith regarded this as a da'eef (weak) hadith but the findings of the majority of the muhadditheen is that there are many narrations on this subject. The differences between this hadith and the ones on fasting are not of such a nature, that it cannot be said that these were on different occasions. Therefore, the necessity does not arise to judge these ahaadith as weak. Many sayings have been mentioned on these two hadith. (a.) The narration of fastening a stone was in the early periods. It is a fact that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu. 'Alayhi Wasallam progressed spiritually as time went by. Therefore the narration on fasting will be that of a later period. (b.) The eating and drinking are particular with fasting. This is witnessed by the general Muslims too, that while in the state of fasting one does not feel the effects of hunger and tiredness as much as when one is not fasting. In this case what could be said regarding Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam when his fasting was of a high calibre and reached completeness. (c.) According to the different times both conditions are of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, like it is with the mashaa-ikh of suluk (spiritual guides), that at different times they experience different conditions. In this manner it will not be necessary to regard this hadith as that of the early periods. It is possible that in later times both conditions were experienced. (d.) Surely the effect of hunger did not affect Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. The fastening of stones was in sympathy and joining the poor and needy by becoming part of them. It is a general rule, that when the great experience some hardships, the fortunate young ones do not pay much attention to their own difficulties. In this case, what could be said of the Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum? whose love for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam knew no bounds. (e.) Allah Ta'aala feeding Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam was surely in honouring him, and not something incumbent. At times when the Sahaabah experienced great poverty and hunger, and it reached such a stage where stones had to be fastened on the stomach, at such a time Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam did not take the benefit of such favours. When a child suffers hunger, food does not go down a mother's gullet. In such a manner what could be said about Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, when his love for the ummah exceeded the love of thousands of mothers.",

        "hadithText": "Abu Huraira said:\n\"Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) went out during an hour in which he did not usually go out, and in which no one used to meet him, but Abu Bakr came to him, so he said: “What has brought you forth, O Abu Bakr?” He replied: “I came out to meet Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace), behold his face, and greet him with the salutation of peace.” Shortly thereafter \"Umar came along, so he said: “What has brought you forth, O 'Umar?” He replied: “Hunger, O Messenger of Allah!” He said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “I have also experienced some of that!” Then they went to the house of Ibn at-Tihan al-Ansari, who was owned many date palms and sheep, but who had no servants, so they did not find him. They therefore asked his wife: “Where is your mate?” She said: “He has gone to draw sweet water for us.” They did not have to wait long before Abu’l-Haitham brought a waterskin that he was carrying full, so he set it down, and came to embrace the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), offering his father and his mother as ransom for him. Then he took them to his garden, and spread a carpet for them. Then he went to a date palm, brought a bunch of dates and set it down. The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Have you not selected for us some of its ripe dates?” He replied: “O Messenger of Allah, I intended to let you choose or prefer some of its ripe and its unripe dates,” so they ate dates and drank from that water. Then the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “By the One in whose Hand is my soul, this is some of the gracious favor about which you shall be asked on the Day of Resurrection: cool shade, good dates and cold water!” Then Abu’l-Haitham went to make a meal for them, so the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Do not slaughter a milch-animal for us.” He therefore slaughtered a young she-goat or a young billy goat, and brought it to them, so they ate. The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Do you have a servant?” When the answer was “No,” he said: “If a prisoner of war comes to us, come to us!” Then he (Allah bless him and give him peace) was brought two captives, unaccompanied by a third. Abu’l-Haitham then came to him, and the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Choose from the pair of them,” so he said: “O Messenger of Allah, choose for me!” The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “The person whose opinion is requested deserves to be trusted. Take this one, for I have seen him performing the ritual prayer, and expect well of him!” Abu l-Haitham then went to his wife and told her what Allah’s Messenger had said, so his wife said: “You cannot arrive at the truth of what the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said about him, except by setting him free!” He said: “He is free, then!” The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Allah has not sent any Prophet, nor any Caliph, without his having two intimate friends: one who commands him to do what is right and fair, and forbids him to do what is wrong and unfair, and one who will spare no effort to corrupt him. If one is wary of the evil companion, he will be preserved from harm.”</b>",

        "comments": "In this hadith Imaam Tirmidhi only wishes to describe the poverty and difficulties. Therefore this hadith has been shortened to show that due to the poverty and hardship the mujahideen did not even get food. This Muslim army ate leaves from the tree and made jihaad. In this hadith Sa'ad Radiyallahu 'Anhu mentioned his good deeds, dedication, and his being from among those veteran Muslims who accepted Islaam in its early stages. The reason for this is that during the reign of 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu, he was amir of Kufah. Some residents of Kufah made many complaints against him to 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu. They even complained that he did not perform salaah properly. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu sent for him. After calling him he said to him: 'The people are lodging many complaints against you. They are even complaining of your salaah'. In reply to that while stating his innocence, he mentioned his being from among the old Muslims, his sufferings in the path of Islaam etc. He said: 'These people threaten me on my salaah. I perform salaah in the same manner I have seen Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam perform it, and I am not lax in the least'. Upon that 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu sent two people with him to Kufah, that they go around and investigate the matter. They did not leave out a single masjid of Kufah wherein they did not go and interview the musallis (worshippers). All praised Sa'ad Radiyallahu 'Anhu, but one person said: 'When you are asking to swear an oath and speak the truth, I shall say the facts to you, that Sa'ad Radiyallhu 'Anhu does not participate in jihaad, as if he is in love with his life. The second is that he does not distribute the wealth equally, and is not just in his verdicts'. Sa'ad Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: He has made three complaints, therefore I shall make three curses upon him. 'O Allah, if this person is a liar, and he has lifted his head for the sake of fame and to show the world, that by criticising a leader, fame is gained, then suitable to every false criticism, lengthen his life, increase in his poverty, and entangle him in mischiefâ€™s'. Thereafter, an eye witness reports that, I saw that person, due to old age his eye lids drooped, he fell into poverty, and molested girls in the streets and alleys. When someone asked him, what had happened to you, he used to reply: 'The curse of Sa'd (Radiyallahu 'Anhu) has befallen me'. O Allah, we seek protection from Your anger, the anger of Your Rasul, and the anger of Your pious servants. Sa'd Radiyallahu 'Anhu has drawn attention to three things in this hadith. (a). That he was the first to shed the blood of a non-believer. This incident took place before the hijrah. The people were suffering hardships and were troubled in Makkah. They hid from the non-believers and performed their salaah and other devotions. Once, a few persons, among whom was also Sa'd Radiyallahu 'Anhu, were performing salaah in a valley. Suddenly a group of non-believers appeared there. They tormented the Muslims and began fighting with them. Sa'd Radiyallahu 'Anhu picked up a jawbone of a camel that was lying there and threw it onto one of the non-believers, as a result blood began to flow. This is what is meant by shedding the blood of the non-believers. (b). That he was the first to shoot an arrow in the path of Allah. This incident took place in the first year hijri. This was the first sariyyah (expedition) that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam sent to Raabigh under the command of 'Ubaydah bin Haarith Radiyallahu 'Anhu. A battle took place against the non-believers, and arrows were shot from both sides. From the side of the Muslims Sa'd Radiyallahu 'Anhu was the first to shoot an arrow. (c). The third is of eating leaves in jihaad. This incident was during the Sariyyah of Khabt,`which according to different sources took place in the fifth year hijri. This incident in brief is that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam sent a group of three hundred Muhaajireen and Ansaar under the command' of 'Ubaydah ibnul Jarraah Radiyallahu 'Anhu to a place on the coast, which was a distance of about five days journey from Madinah Munawwarah, against the tribe of Juhaynah. In the beginning three camels were slaughtered daily. When the amir forbade the slaughtering of camels fearing these would decrease, dates were distributed. These also decreased till everyone received only one date daily. They kept on sucking it and drank water. When this too became scarce, the time came when leaves had to be shaken off trees and eaten. The meaning of khabt is to shake off leaves, therefore this sariyyah became well known as the Sariyyah of Khabt. The beginning of this incident was difficult and full of obstacles, and the end that of pleasantness, which could be read in the books on the history of Islaam. It has been briefly mentioned by this humble servant in the third chapter of my book 'Stories of the Sahaabah'.",
