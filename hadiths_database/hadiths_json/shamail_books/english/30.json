In the narration mentioned by Abu Dawood and others it is clearly stated, and there also may be a probability that sharbat of honey or nabeedh of dates are meant, as has been mentioned in the chapter on the cup of Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam. Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam did not pay much attention to food. Whatever was available was eaten, but sweet and cold water was given importance. Sweet water was brought for Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam from a place called Suqya, which is a few kilometres from Madinah. Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam also added the following duâ€™aa in the words of Dawood alaihis salaam, that Oâ€™ Allah grant me such love for You, which is more beloved to me than my life, wealth, wife, children, and cold water.",

He said to me: 'The drink is yours, but if you wish, you may let Khalid have it.' I said: 'I wouldn't give up your leftover drink for anyone!' Then Allah’s Messenger said (Allah bless him and give him peace): 'If Allah feeds someone a meal, let him say: ‘O Allah, bless us in it, and give us something even better!’ If Allah (Almighty and Glorious is He) gives a person some milk to drink, let him say: ‘O Allah, bless us in it, and grant us more of it!’ Then Allah’s Messenger said (Allah bless him and give him peace): 'Nothing but milk can substitute for both food and drink'!\"</b>",

As is mentioned in many ahaadith that the cup etc. should be passed from right to left, Sayyidina Rasoollullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam requested the giving of preference to Sayyidina Khalid ibn Waleed radiyllahu anhu, as he was elder. It was also intended to educate Sayyidina Ibn Abbas radiyallahu anhu that, though it was his right, it is better to give an elder preference. But the love Sayyidina Ibn Abbas radiyallahu anhu had for Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam naturally made him not give up this right for the left over milk of Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam.",
