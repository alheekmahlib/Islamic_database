For this reason some ulama have prohibited the drinking of Zam-zam also whilst standing. They say that he drank it whilst standing because of the huge crowds and the rush, or as a concession. The well-known view of the ulama is that Zam-zam is not included in this prohibition. It is better to stand and drink it.",

A narration of Sayyidina Abu Hurairah radiyallahu anhu is mentioned in Sahih Muslim that Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, No person should stand and drink water, and if one forgetfully stood and drank it, it should be vomited out. Some ulama have summed both the deed and the prohibition in a few ways. Some ulama are of the opinion that the prohibition came later and repeals the previous law. Some ulama hold the opposite view that the narrations where he stood and drank water repeals the one that prohibits it. According to a well-known saying, the prohibition is not that of a Sharâ€™ee or unlawful nature, but as an etiquette. It is also a blessing and kindness. Ibn Qayyim and others have mentioned the harm that standing and drinking causes. In short, Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam standing and drinking shows it being permissible to do so, and that it is not haraam to stand and drink water. It is best not do so, as this is against the recommended practice and one will be committing a makrooh act by doing so.",

To call this wudhu will be metaphorical.<br><br>The feet are not mentioned here but presumably he did masah of them also.<br><br>Another elucidation may be that in this hadith the washing of the limbs lightly has been metaphorically explained as masah.<br><br>This explanation is supported by some narrations where, instead of masah, washing of the face and hands and also the washing of the feet is mentioned. In this case the renewal of wudhu is meant. This exposition is best according to this humble servant.<br><br>We also find from this hadith that it is permissible to stand and drink the left over water after wudhu. The permissibility of drinking this water and the water of Zam-zam while standing is mentioned in the kitaabs of fiqh (jurisprudence). Allaamah Shaami has mentioned the experience of some Ulama that it is a tested and proved antidote for diseases. Mulla Ali Qari has mentioned this act as meritorious in the commentary of the Shamaail.",

The minimum number of sips one can take is mentioned in this hadith. Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam at times drank water in two sips to show that this was the minimum amount of gulps one could take. Another explanation may be this that in the hadith it meant that two breaths should be taken whilst drinking water. If two breaths are taken whilst drinking water, then all the water will naturally be drunk in three gulps. By this explanation there remains no contradiction between this and the last hadith.",

Tabarrukan (for barakah), because the mubaarak saliva of Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam had come in contact with it and she wanted to keep it.<br><br>2. She did not want anybody else to drink from the same portion where Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam had drank. The reason being respect and courtesy. It will be disrespectful if someone else drank from the same place. There are two things mentioned in this hadith. One is standing and drinking which has already been discussed in Hadith 4. The second is that it is reported in the Bukhari from Sayyidina Anas radiyallahu anhu that it has been prohibited to drink from the mouth of a water bag. Therefore we shall take this hadith to show the permissibility of doing so. It is related in a hadith that a person was drinking from a water bag and a snake came out from it. On hearing this Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam forbade the drinking of water direct from a water bag.<br><br>According to this hadith, the drinking of water in this manner apparently seems to have taken place in the early period. A special note should be made here. One of the reasons of prohibiting the drinking of water in this manner is that every personâ€™s mouth is not such that if it touches a water bag etc. it will not leave a smell. Certainly there are mouths whose saliva is a cure of diseases, and which is more tastier than everything in the world and creates more happiness than everything else. Therefore the drinking of Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam from a water bag cannot be compared with others.",
