We faced hardship (in getting provisions) until we decided to slaughter some of our riding animals. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), commanded us to pool our provisions of food. So we spread a sheet of leather and the provisions of the people were collected on it. I stretched myself to measure how much that was (the length and breadth of the sheet on which the provisions were laid). I measured it and (found) that it was (in length and breadth) of (so much size) on which a goat could sit. We were fourteen hundred persons. We (all) ate until we were fully satisfied and then filled our bags with provisions. Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: Is there any water for performing ablution. Then there came a man with a small bucket containing some water. He threw it in a basin. We all fourteen hundred persons performed ablution using the water in plenty. Then there came after that eight persons and they said: Is there any water to perform ablution? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: The ablution has already been performed.</b>",
