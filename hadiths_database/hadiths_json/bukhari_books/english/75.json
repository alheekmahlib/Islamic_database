He mounted me behind \nhim and went to visit Sa`d bin 'Ubada, and that had been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet (ﷺ) \nproceeded till he passed by a gathering in which `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that \nhad been before `Abdullah embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., \nisolators and Jews. `Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the \ndonkey covered the gathering, `Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and said, \n\"Do not trouble us with dust.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them, stopped and dismounted. Then he invited \nthem to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them some verses of the Holy Qur'an. On that, \n`Abdullah bin Ubai said, \"O man ! There is nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not \ntrouble us with it in our gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him \nthere.\" On that `Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Bring your teachings to our \ngathering, for we love that.\" So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing each other till \nthey were about to fight. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till they became calm. Thereupon the \nProphet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa`d bin Ubada. He said to him \"O \nSa`d! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e., `Abdullah bin Ubai) said?\" Sa`d said, 'O Allah's \nApostle! Excuse and forgive him, for Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this \ntown (Medina decided unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on his \nhead, but when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (`Abdullah bin Ubai) \nwas grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way you have \nseen.\"</b>",
