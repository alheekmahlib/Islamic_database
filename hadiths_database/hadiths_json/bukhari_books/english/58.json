While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the \nEarths, Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves \na Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, has \nordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and our Prophet has \ninformed us that our Lord says:-- \"Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e. martyred), shall go to Paradise \nto lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become \nyour master.\" (Al-Mughira, then blamed An-Nu`man for delaying the attack and) An-Nu' man said to \nAl-Mughira, \"If you had participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he would \nnot have blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you.
