The people started clapping and \nthey clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned \nround and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) standing behind him. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned him with his hand to keep on \npraying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in \nthe (first) row, and the Prophet (ﷺ) went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet (ﷺ) \nfinished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, \"O people! When something happens to \nyou during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If \nsomething happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Allah', (Glorified be Allah), for \nwhoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you \nfrom leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"It \ndid not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet.</b>",
