Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two \nmountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin \nRabi`a and `Utba bin Rabi`a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of \nepidemics.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, \"O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even \nmore than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and \nmake the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.\" Aisha added: When \nwe reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah's lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of \nMedina) used to flow with impure colored water.</b>",
