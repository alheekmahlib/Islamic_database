        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Samura bin Jundab:\n\n<p>Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, \"Who amongst you \nhad a dream last night?\" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet (ﷺ) would say: \n\"Ma sha'a-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, 'What Allah wished,' and it indicates a good \nomen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The \nProphet said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, \nand took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with \nan iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then \ntore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side \nof his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, 'What is \nthis?' They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and \nanother man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the \nLying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. \nThe man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its \nnormal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is this?' They told \nme to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide \nbottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people \nwere lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the \npeople went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told \nme to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and \nanother man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. \nWhenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and \ncaused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would \nthrow a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, 'What is this?' They \ntold me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree \nand near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with \nfire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up \nthe tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and \nyoung men, women and children. \nThen they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house \nthat was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two \ncompanions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.' They said, \n'Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and \nthe people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be \npunished like that till the Day of Resurrection. \nThe one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of \nQur'an (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not \nuse to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of \nResurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who \ncommit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba \n(usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children \naround him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the \ngatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common \nbelievers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.' \nI raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me \nenter my place.' They said, 'You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you \ncomplete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.' \"</b>",

Go to the \nmother of the believers Aisha and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,' and request \nher to allow me to be buried with my companions.\" (So, Ibn `Umar conveyed the message to `Aisha.) \nShe said, \"I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (`Umar) to myself (and \nallow him to be buried there).\" When `Abdullah bin `Umar returned, `Umar asked him, \"What (news) \ndo you have?\" He replied, \"O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).\" On \nthat `Umar said, \"Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when \nI expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (`Aisha ) and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab asks \npermission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the \ngraveyard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with \nwhom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the \npeople after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,\" and then he \nmentioned the name of `Uthman, `Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and Sa`d bin Abi \nWaqqas. \nBy this time a young man from Ansar came and said, \"O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah's \nglad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you \nruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.\" `Umar replied, \"O son of \nmy brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither \nlose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their \nrights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar \nwho before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the \nrighteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules \nand regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their \ncontracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.\"</b>",
