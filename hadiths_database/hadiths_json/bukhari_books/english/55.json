So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless \nthey paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of \nthem. Later on the people asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:-- \n\"They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding \nthem...\" (4.127) \nand in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would \nhave the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, \nbut if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry \nsome other woman instead of her.
