O people! Neither you will have any disgrace nor will you regret.\" They said, \"O Allah's \nApostle! Between you and us there are the infidels of the tribe of Mudar, so please order us to do \nsomething good (religious deeds) that by acting on them we may enter Paradise, and that we may \ninform (our people) whom we have left behind, about it.\" They also asked (the Prophet) about drinks. \nHe forbade them from four things and ordered them to do four things. He ordered them to believe in \nAllah, and asked them, \"Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah?\" They said, \"Allah and His \nApostle know best.\" He said, ''To testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, the \nOne, Who has no partners with Him, and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); and to offer prayers \nperfectly and to pay Zakat.\" (the narrator thinks that fasting in Ramadan is included), \"and to give \none-fifth of the war booty (to the state).\" Then he forbade four (drinking utensils): Ad-Duba', Al56 \nHantam, Al-Mazaffat and An-Naqir, or probably, Al-Muqaiyar. And then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \n\"Remember all these things by heart and preach it to those whom you have left behind.\"</b>",
