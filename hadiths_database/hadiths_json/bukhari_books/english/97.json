        "hadithText": "<p>\n\n     Narrated 'Ata' bin Yazid Al-Laithi:\n<p>\n\n     On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! \n     Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \n     \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?\" \n     They said, \"No, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" He said, \"Do you have any \n     difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?\" They said, \n     \"No, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" He said, \"So you will see Him, like that. \n     Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say, \n     'Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that \n     thing),' so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and \n     whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to \n     worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities. \n     And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its \n     hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come \n     to them and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will (deny Him and) say, 'We \n     will stay here till our Lord comes, for when our Lord comes, we will \n     recognize Him.' So Allah will come to them in His appearance which \n     they know, and will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our\n     Lord,' so they will follow Him. \n<p>\n\n     Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)' I and my followers will\n     be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day \n     except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day \n     will be, 'O Allah, save! Save!' In Hell (or over The Bridge) there \n     will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa'dan (thorny plant). Have you \n     seen As-Sa'dan? \" They replied, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"So\n     those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa'dan, but none knows how big \n     they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according\n     to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) \n     because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the \n     hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then \n     relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He \n     will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then\n     order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship\n     none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to \n     and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be \n     worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by \n     the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat \n     up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah \n     has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come \n     out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life \n     will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed \n     that comes in the mud of the torrent. \n<p>\n\n     Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and there will \n     remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person \n     among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, 'O my Lord! \n     Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and\n     its severe heat has burnt me.' So he will invoke Allah in the way \n     Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, 'If I \n     grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply, \n     'No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.' He \n     will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Allah will demand. \n<p>\n\n     So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face \n     Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah \n     will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, 'O my Lord! Bring me \n     near to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will say to him, 'Didn't you give\n     your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more\n     than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam's son! How \n     treacherous you are!' He will say, 'O my lord,' and will keep on \n     invoking Allah till He says to him, 'If I give what you are asking, \n     will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply, 'No, by Your \n     (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.'\n<p>\n\n     Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then Allah will \n     bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of \n     Paradise, Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will \n     see its splendor and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long \n     as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my \n     Lord! Admit me into Paradise.' Allah will say, 'Didn't you give your \n     covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than \n     what you had been given?' Allah will say, 'Woe on you, O Adam's son! \n     How treacherous you are! ' \n<p>\n\n     The man will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of \n     Your creation,' and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will \n     laugh because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of \n     him, He will say to him, 'Enter Paradise,' and when he will enter it, \n     Allah will say to him, 'Wish for anything.' So he will ask his Lord, \n     and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself will \n     remind him to wish for certain things by saying, '(Wish for) \n     so-and-so.' When there is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, \n     'This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well.\"\n<p>\n\n     'Ata' bin Yazid added: Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri who was present with Abu \n     Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira \n     said that Allah had said, \"That is for you and its equal as well,\" Abu\n     Sa'id Al-Khudri said, \"And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!\" Abu \n     Huraira said, \"I do not remember, except his saying, 'That is for you \n     and its equal as well.'\" Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri then said, \"I testify \n     that I remember the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'That is for you, and ten times as\n     much.'

So the companions of the cross will\n     go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and\n     the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, \n     till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient \n     ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the \n     Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage.\n     Then it will be said to the Jews, \"What did you use to worship?' They \n     will reply, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.' It will be \n     said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. \n     What do you want (now)?' They will reply, 'We want You to provide us \n     with water.' Then it will be said to them 'Drink,' and they will fall \n     down in Hell (instead).

They will say, 'We parted with them (in the world) when we were\n     in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one \n     proclaiming, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship,' and \n     now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will come to them \n     in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He \n     will say, 'I am your Lord,' and they will say, 'You are not our Lord.'\n     And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be\n     said to them, 'Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?' \n     They will say. 'The Shin,' and so Allah will then uncover His Shin \n     whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will \n     remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and\n     for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but \n     their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not \n     be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.\" We, \n     the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is the \n     bridge?'\n<p>\n\n     He said, \"It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and \n     (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the \n     other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in \n     Najd and is called As-Sa'dan. Some of the believers will cross the \n     bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as \n     lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be \n     safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some \n     scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person \n     will cross by being dragged (over the bridge).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You\n     (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has\n     been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with\n     Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see \n     themselves safe. \n<p>\n\n     They will say, 'O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray \n     with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.' Allah will say,\n     'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal \n     to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.' Allah will forbid the Fire to burn\n     the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them\n     in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their \n     legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then \n     they will return, and Allah will say (to them), 'Go and take out (of \n     Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one \n     half Dinar.' They will take out whomever they will recognize and \n     return, and then Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in \n     whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a \n     smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will \n     recognize.\" Abu Sa'id said: If you do not believe me then read the \n     Holy Verse:--\n<p>\n\n     'Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest\n     ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.'

He will then hold a handful of the Fire from \n     which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and \n     they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called \n     the water of life. \n<p>\n\n     They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. \n     You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how \n     the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the \n     shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like\n     pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will \n     enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, 'These are \n     the people emancipated by the Beneficent.

Adam will say, 'I \n     am not fit for this undertaking.' He will mention his mistakes he had \n     committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden \n     to do so.

The people will go to Noah who will say, 'I \n     am not fit for this undertaking' He will mention his mistake which he \n     had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.' He will say \n     (to them), 'Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.' They will go to Abraham \n     who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. He would mention \n     three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). 'Go to Moses, a\n     slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought \n     near Him, for conversation.' \n<p>\n\n     They will go to Moses who will say, 'I am not fit for this \n     undertaking.

Behold, \nAnas was in his palace, and our arrival coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter \nand he admitted us while he was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, \"Do not ask him about anything \nelse first but the Hadith of Intercession.\" He said, \"O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren from Basra \ncoming to ask you about the Hadith of Intercession.\" Anas then said, \"Muhammad talked to us saying, \n'On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with each other like waves, and then they will come \nto Adam and say, 'Please intercede for us with your Lord.' He will say, 'I am not fit for that but you'd \nbetter go to Abraham as he is the Khalil of the Beneficent.' They will go to Abraham and he will say, \n'I am not fit for that, but you'd better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.' So \nthey will go to Moses and he will say, 'I am not fit for that, but you'd better go to Jesus as he is a soul \ncreated by Allah and His Word.' (Be: And it was) they will go to Jesus and he will say, 'I am not fit for \nthat, but you'd better go to Muhammad.' \nThey would come to me and I would say, 'I am for that.' Then I will ask for my Lord's permission, and \nit will be given, and then He will inspire me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So \nI will praise Him with those praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, 'O \nMuhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted \n(your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my \nfollowers! My followers!' And then it will be said, 'Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all those who have \nfaith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.' I will go and do so and return to praise Him \nwith the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before Him. Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad, raise \nyour head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and \nintercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my followers! My followers!' It \nwill be said, 'Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the weight of a \nsmall ant or a mustard seed.' I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and \nfall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, 'O, Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for \nyou will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your \nintercession will be accepted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my followers!' Then He will say, 'Go and take out \n(all those) in whose hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of \nthe Fire.' I will go and do so.\"' \nWhen we left Anas, I said to some of my companions, \"Let's pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself \nin the house of Abi Khalifa and request him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.\" So we went to \nhim and we greeted him and he admitted us. We said to him, \"O Abu Sa`id! We came to you from \nyour brother Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I \nhave never heard.\" He said, \"What is that?\" Then we told him of the Hadith and said, \"He stopped at \nthis point (of the Hadith).\" He said, \"What then?\" We said, \"He did not add anything to that.\" He said, \nAnas related the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don't know whether he \nforgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.\" We said, \"O Abu Sa`id ! Let \nus know that.\" He smiled and said, \"Man was created hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted \nto inform you of it. \nAnas told me the same as he told you and said that the Prophet (ﷺ) added, 'I then return for a fourth time \nand praise Him similarly and prostrate before Him me the same as he 'O Muhammad, raise your head \nand speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, \nfor your intercession will be accepted .' I will say, 'O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever said, \n'None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.' Then Allah will say, 'By my Power, and my \nMajesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell (Fire) whoever said: \n'None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.'

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Anas bin Malik:\n\n<p>The night Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was taken for a journey from the sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka`ba: \nThree persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the \nDivine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of them said, \"Which of them is he?\" The middle \n(second) angel said, \"He is the best of them.\" The last (third) angle said, \"Take the best of them.\" Only \nthat much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another night, i.e. after \nThe Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fath-ul-Bari Page 258, Vol. 17) and he saw them, his \neyes were asleep but his heart was not----and so is the case with the prophets: their eyes sleep while \ntheir hearts do not sleep. So those angels did not talk to him till they carried him and placed him \nbeside the well of Zamzam. From among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part \nof his body) between his throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his \nchest and `Abdomen and then washed it with Zamzam water with his own hands till he cleansed the \ninside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought \nand then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it (the chest). He \nthen ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on one of its doors. \nThe dwellers of the Heaven asked, 'Who is it?' He said, \"Gabriel.\" They said, \"Who is accompanying \nyou?\" He said, \"Muhammad.\" They said, \"Has he been called?\" He said, \"Yes\" They said, \"He is \nwelcomed.\" So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with his arrival, and they did not know \nwhat Allah would do to the Prophet (ﷺ) on earth unless Allah informed them. The Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam over \nthe nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the Prophet, \"He is your father; greet him.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) greeted \nhim and Adam returned his greeting and said, \"Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!\" \nBehold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, \"What are these two \nrivers, O Gabriel?\" Gabriel said, \"These are the sources of the Nile and the Euphrates.\" \nThen Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw another river at the bank of which \nthere was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put his hand into the river and found its mud like \nmusk Adhfar. He asked, \"What is this, O Gabriel?\" Gabriel said, \"This is the Kauthar which your Lord \nhas kept for you.\" Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the \nsame questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., \"Who is it?\" Gabriel replied, \"Gabriel\". They asked, \n\"Who is accompanying you?\" He said, \"Muhammad.\" They asked, \"Has he been sent for?\" He said, \n\"Yes.\" Then they said, \"He is welcomed.'' Then he (Gabriel) ascended with the Prophet (ﷺ) to the third \nHeaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first and the second Heavens had said. \nThen he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with \nhim to the fifth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven \nand they said the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On \neach Heaven there were prophets whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on \nthe second Heaven, Aaron on the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don't remember, on \nthe fifth Heaven, Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his \nprivilege of talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), \"O Lord! I thought that none would be \nraised up above me.\" \nBut Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance above that, the distance of which only \nAllah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the \nLord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths \nor (even) nearer. (It is said that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate \nAl-Bari Page 263, 264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: \"Fifty \nprayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night.\" \nThen the Prophet (ﷺ) descended till he met Moses, and then Moses stopped him and asked, \"O \nMuhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied,\" He enjoined upon me to \nperform fifty prayers in a day and a night.\" Moses said, \"Your followers cannot do that; Go back so \nthat your Lord may reduce it for you and for them.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) turned to Gabriel as if he wanted \nto consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, \"Yes, if you wish.\" So Gabriel \nascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in his place, \"O Lord, please lighten our \nburden as my followers cannot do that.\" So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he \nreturned to Moses who stopped him again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined \nprayers were reduced to only five prayers. \nThen Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to five and said, \"O Muhammad! By \nAllah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to do less than this, but they could not do it and gave \nit up. However, your followers are weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so \nthat He may lighten your burden.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel did not disapprove of that. So he ascended \nwith him for the fifth time. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, \nhearing and constitution, so lighten our burden.\" On that the Irresistible said, \"O Muhammad!\" the \nProphet replied, \"Labbaik and Sa`daik.\" Allah said, \"The Word that comes from Me does not change, \nso it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the Book.\" Allah added, \"Every good deed will be \nrewarded as ten times so it is fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to \nperform only five (in practice).\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) returned to Moses who asked, \"What have you done?\" He said, \"He has lightened our \nburden: He has given us for every good deed a tenfold reward.\" Moses said, \"By Allah! I tried to \nmake Bani Israel observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may \nlighten your burden further.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of returning too \nmany times to my Lord.\" On that Gabriel said, \"Descend in Allah's Name.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then woke \nwhile he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca).</b>",
