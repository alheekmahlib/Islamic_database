When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived at Medina, Sa`d went to perform `Umra and \nstayed at Umaiya's home in Mecca. He said to Umaiya, \"Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is \nempty so that I may be able to perform Tawaf around the Ka`ba.\" So Umaiya went with him about \nmidday. Abu Jahl met them and said, \"O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?\" He said, \n\"He is Sa`d.\" Abu Jahl addressed Sa`d saying, \"I see you wandering about safely in Mecca inspite of \nthe fact that you have given shelter to the people who have changed their religion (i.e. became \nMuslims) and have claimed that you will help them and support them. By Allah, if you were not in the \ncompany of Abu Safwan, you would not be able to go your family safely.\" Sa`d, raising his voice, \nsaid to him, \"By Allah, if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would \ncertainly prevent you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through \nMedina.\" On this, Umaiya said to him, \"O Sa`d do not raise your voice before Abu-l-Hakam, the chief \nof the people of the Valley (of Mecca).\" Sa`d said, \"O Umaiya, stop that! By Allah, I have heard \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) predicting that the Muslim will kill you.\" Umaiya asked, \"In Mecca?\" Sa`d said, \"I do \nnot know.\" Umaiya was greatly scared by that news. \nWhen Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife, \"O Um Safwan! Don't you know what Sa`d \ntold me? \"She said, \"What has he told you?\" He replied, \"He claims that Muhammad has informed \nthem (i.e. companions that they will kill me. I asked him, 'In Mecca?' He replied, 'I do not know.\" \nThen Umaiya added, \"By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca.\" But when the day of (the Ghazwa of) \nBadr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, \"Go and protect your caravan.\" But Umaiya \ndisliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said, \"O Abu Safwan! If the people see you \nstaying behind though you are the chief of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with \nyou.\" Abu Jahl kept on urging him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, \"As you have forced me to \nchange my mind, by Allah, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). \"O \nUm Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey).\" She said to him, \"O Abu Safwan! Have you \nforgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?\" He said, \"No, but I do not want to go with them but \nfor a short distance.\" So when Umaiya went out, he used to tie his camel wherever he camped.

When they reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between 'Usfan and \nMecca, their presence was made known to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent \nabout one hundred archers after them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found \nthe traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, \"These dates \nare of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),\" and went on tracing the Muslims' footsteps. When `Asim and his \ncompanions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them \nand said, \"Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not \nkill anyone of you.\" `Asim bin Thabit said, \"O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be \nunder the protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.\" So the archers threw their \narrows at them and martyred `Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting \ntheir promise and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the \narchers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with them. \nThe third man said, \"This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not go with you for I follow \nthe example of these.\" He meant the martyred companions. The archers dragged him and struggled \nwith him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them \nand later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca after the event of the Badr battle. \nThe sons of Al-Harit bin `Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for he was a person who had killed (their \nfather) Al-Hari bin `Amr on the day (of the battle) of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till \nthey decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a \nrazor for shaving his pubic hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little \nson of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the \nrazor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, \"Are you \nafraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.\" Later on (while narrating the story) she \nsaid, \"By Allah, I had never seen a better captive than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating \nfrom a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was \nno fruit in Mecca.\" She used to say,\" It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.\" \nWhen they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr him, Khubaib requested them. \n\"Allow me to offer a two-rak`at prayer.\" They allowed him and he prayed two rak`at and then said, \n\"By Allah! Had I not been afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.\" \nThen he (invoked evil upon them) saying, \"O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and do not \nleave anyone of them\"' Then he recited: \"As I am martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I \nreceive my death for Allah's Sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the \ncut limbs of my body.\" Then Abu Sarva, 'Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was \nKhubaib who set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is \nexecuted). The Prophet (ﷺ) told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same \nday they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of `Asim bin Thabit's death, sent some \nmessengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had \npreviously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a swarm of wasps to \nprotect the dead body of `Asim, and they shielded him from the messengers who could not cut \nanything from his body.</b>",

Judge between \nme and this (i.e. `Ali). \"Both of them had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which \nAllah had given to His Apostle as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), `Ali and `Abbas started \nreproaching each other. The (present) people (i.e. `Uthman and his companions) said, \"O chief of the \nbelievers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other.\" `Umar said, \"Wait I \nbeseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the earth stand fast! Do you know \nthat Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'We (Prophets) our properties are not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, \nis to be spent in charity,' and he said it about himself?\" They (i.e. `Uthman and his company) said, \"He \ndid say it. \"`Umar then turned towards `Ali and `Abbas and said, \"I beseech you both, by Allah! Do \nyou know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said this?\" They replied in the affirmative. He said, \"Now I am talking \nto you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty \nwon without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else. Allah said:-- \n\"And what Allah gave to His Apostle (\"Fai\"\" Booty) from them--For which you made no expedition \nWith either Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will \nAnd Allah is able to do all things.\" (59.6) \nSo this property was especially granted to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . But by Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) neither took it \nall for himself only, nor deprived you of it, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you \ntill only this remained out of it. And from this Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to spend the yearly maintenance \nfor his family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah's Property is spent (i.e. in \ncharity), Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and Abu Bakr said, 'I \nam the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge of this property and disposed \nof it in the same manner as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and all of you (at that time) knew all about it.\" \nThen `Umar turned towards `Ali and `Abbas and said, \"You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of \nit in the way you have described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly \nguided and the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, 'I am the successor \nof Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr.' So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of \nmy rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr \nused to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere, pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right \n(in this matte Later on both of you (i.e. `Ali and `Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was \none and the same, O `Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Our \nproperty is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' \nThen when I thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you \nwill promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nand Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or else you should not speak \nto me (about it).' So, both of you said to me, 'Hand it over to us on this condition.' And on this \ncondition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now to give a decision other than that (decision)? \nBy Allah, with Whose Permission both the sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision \nother than that (decision) till the Last Hour is established. \nBut if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your \nbehalf.\" The sub-narrator said, \"I told `Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, 'Malik bin Aus \nhas told the truth\" I heard `Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, 'The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) sent \n`Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted to his \nApostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don't you know that the \nProphet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity? \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned that regarding himself. He added: 'The family of Muhammad can take their \nsustenance from this property. So the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) stopped demanding it when I told them of \nthat.' So, this property (of Sadaqa) was in the hands of `Ali who withheld it from `Abbas and \noverpowered him. Then it came in the hands of Hasan bin `Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin `Ali, \nand then in the hands of `Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to \nmanage it in turn, then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah's \nApostle .\"</b>",

Abu Rafi` used to hurt Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and help his enemies against him. He \nlived in his castle in the land of Hijaz. When those men approached (the castle) after the sun had set \nand the people had brought back their livestock to their homes. `Abdullah (bin Atik) said to his \ncompanions, \"Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the gate-keeper so \nthat I may enter (the castle).\" \nSo `Abdullah proceeded towards the castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with \nhis clothes, pretending to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper \n(considered `Abdullah as one of the castle's servants) addressing him saying, \"O Allah's Servant! \nEnter if you wish, for I want to close the gate.\" `Abdullah added in his story, \"So I went in (the castle) \nand hid myself. When the people got inside, the gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a \nfixed wooden peg. I got up and took the keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at \nnight with Abu Rafi` for a pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly \nentertainment went away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I \nsaid to myself, 'Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till I have \nkilled him.' \nSo I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his \nlocation in the house. So I shouted, 'O Abu Rafi`!' Abu Rafi` said, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the \nsource of the voice and hit him with the sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He \ncried loudly, and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, \n'What is this voice, O Abu Rafi`?' He said, 'Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a \nsword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the sword into his \nbelly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized that I have killed him. \nI then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase, and thinking that I had reached the \nground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a \nturban and proceeded on till I sat at the gate, and said, 'I will not go out tonight till I know that I have \nkilled him.' So, when (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on \nthe wall saying, 'I announce the death of Abu Rafi`, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my \ncompanions and said, 'Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi`,' So I (along with my \ncompanions proceeded and) went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and described the whole story to him. \"He said, \n'Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it and it became All right as if I had \nnever had any ailment whatsoever.\"</b>",

I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my head and legs and \npretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, 'Whoever wants to come in, should \ncome in before I close the gate.' So I went in and hid myself in a stall of a donkey near the gate of the \ncastle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi` and had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to \ntheir homes. \nWhen the voices vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the \ngate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked the gate of the \ncastle, saying to myself, 'If these people should notice me, I will run away easily.' Then I locked all \nthe doors of their houses from outside while they were inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi` by a \nstaircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with its light off, and I could not know where the man \nwas. So I called, 'O Abu Rafi`!' He replied, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He \ncried loudly but my blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a \ndifferent tone of my voice, ' What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi`?' He said, 'Are you not surprised? \nWoe on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!' So again I aimed at him and \nhit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi` cried loudly and his wife got up. \nI came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi` lying straight on his \nback, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the sound of a bone break. Then I \ncame out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase to descend, but I fell down from it and got \nmy leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to my companions limping. I said (to them), 'Go and tell \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) of this good news, but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu \nRafi`'s) death.' When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, 'I convey \nto you the news of Abu Rafi`'s death.' I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I caught up \nwith my companions before they reached the Prophet (ﷺ) to whom I conveyed the good news.\"</b>",

When we reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), \n'Ubaidullah bin `Adi said (to me), \"Would you like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the \nkilling of Hamza?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and \nsomebody said to us, \"He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin.\" So we went \nup to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he greeted us in return. \n'Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except his eyes and feet. 'Ubaidullah \nsaid, \"O Wahshi! Do you know me?\" Wahshi looked at him and then said, \"No, by Allah! But I know \nthat `Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she \ndelivered a boy for him at Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that \nchild along with his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child's \nfeet.\" Then 'Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), \"Will you tell us (the story of) the \nkilling of Hamza?\" Wahshi replied \"Yes, Hamza killed Tuaima bin `Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr \n(battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut`im said to me, 'If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then \nyou will be set free.\" \nWhen the people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of 'Ainain ..'Ainain is a mountain near the \nmountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the people for the \nbattle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba' came out and said, 'Is there any (Muslim) to accept \nmy challenge to a duel?' Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib came out and said, 'O Siba'. O Ibn Um Anmar, \nthe one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge Allah and His Apostle?' Then Hamza \nattacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a \nrock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus \nso that it came out through his buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I \ntoo returned with them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and \nwhen the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I was told that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not \nharm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \nWhen he saw me, he said, 'Are you Wahshi?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Was it you who killed Hamza?' I \nreplied, 'What happened is what you have been told of.' He said, 'Can you hide your face from me?' So \nI went out when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) died, and Musailamah Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a \nprophet). I said, 'I will go out to Musailamah so that I may kill him, and make amends for killing \nHamza. So I went out with the people (to fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events \ntook place concerning that battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a \nwall. He looked like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him, \ndriving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders, and then an \nAnsari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. `Abdullah bin `Umar said, 'A slave \ngirl on the roof of a house said: Alas!

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\n\n<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) sent a Sariya of spies and appointed `Asim bin Thabit, the grandfather of `Asim bin \n`Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set out, and when they reached (a place) between \n'Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, \nabout one-hundred archers followed their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station \nwhere they (i.e. `Asim and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought \nas journey food from Medina. \nThe archers said, \"These are the dates of Medina,\" and followed their traces till they took them over. \nWhen `Asim and his companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their \npursuers encircled them and said, \"You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to us, \nwe will not kill anyone of you.\" `Asim said, \"As for me, I will never come down on the security of an \ninfidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us.\" So they fought with them till they killed `Asim along \nwith seven of his companions with arrows, and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to \nwhom they gave a promise and a covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, \nthey came down. When they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them \nwith it. The third man who was with them said, \"This is the first breach in the covenant,\" and refused \nto accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but he refused, and \nthey killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they sold them in Mecca. The \nsons of Al-Harith bin `Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin \n`Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for a while as a captive till they decided \nunanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al- \nHarith to shave his pubic hair. She gave it to him. She said later on, \"I was heedless of a little baby of \nmine, who moved towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. \nWhen I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my distress while he was carrying the razor \nin his hand. He said 'Are you afraid that I will kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,' \" Later on she \nused to say, \"I have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of \ngrapes although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron chains, \nand in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.\" So they took him out of the \nSanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, \"Allow me to offer a two-rak`at prayer.\" Then he went to \nthem and said, \"Had I not been afraid that you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed \nfor a longer time.\" So it was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two rak`at before being \nexecuted. He then said, \"O Allah! Count them one by one,\" and added, 'When I am being martyred as \na Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah's Sake, because this death is in \nAllah's Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.\" Then `Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and \nmartyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish (infidels) sent some people to `Asim in order to bring \na part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for `Asim had killed one of their chiefs \non the day of Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers \nwho could not harm his body consequently.</b>",

I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our) \ngoing out.\" So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet (ﷺ) and it was Al-Jad`a . They both \nrode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where they hid themselves. \nAmir bin Fuhaira was the slave of `Abdullah bin at-Tufail bin Sakhbara `Aisha's brother from her \nmother's side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel.

When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. 'Amir) too \nwent along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns till they \nreached Medina. 'Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma'una. \nNarrated `Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma'una were martyred and `Amr bin Umaiya Ad- \nDamri was taken prisoner, 'Amir bin at-Tufail, pointing at a killed person, asked `Amr, \"Who is this?\" \n`Amr bin Umaiya said to him, \"He is 'Amir bin Fuhaira.\" 'Amir bin at-Tufail said, \"I saw him lifted to \nthe sky after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought down \nupon the earth.

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated `Aisha:\n\n<p>Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots amongst his wives, and \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to take with him the one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of \nthe Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Allah's \norder of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah \nand carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had \nfinished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. \nWhen we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So \nwhen they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after \nfinishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my \nnecklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was \nmissing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) \nthe people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of \nmy camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light \nin weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat \nonly a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and \ncarrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left \n(along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone. \nThen I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the \ncall. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come \nback to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and \nslept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my \nplace in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he \nhad seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited \nIstirja' (i.e. \"Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with \nmy head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying \nany word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg \non its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying \nme till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). \n(Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the \nIfk (i.e. slander) more, was `Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.\" \n(Urwa said, \"The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence \nand he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.\" `Urwa also added, \"None \nwas mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and \nMistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but \nthey were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Salul.\" `Urwa added, \"`Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she \nused to say, 'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and my honor are all for the \nprotection of Muhammad's honor from you.\"). \n`Aisha added, \"After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating \nthe forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my \npresent ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as I used to receive when \nI got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and \nleave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my \nconvalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature \nand we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had \nlatrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the \nhabits of the old 'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near \nour houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin `Abd \nManaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and \nwhose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin `Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to \nmy house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot \nentangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said, 'What a hard word \nyou have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you \nHantah! Didn't you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?' \nThen she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached \nmy home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will \nyou allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah's \nApostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people \ntalking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is \nloved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would \nfind faults with her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really \ntalking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then \nin the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing \nme. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for \nme. Usama said, '(O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good \nabout her.' `Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there \nare plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything \nwhich aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have \nnever seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who \nsleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' \nSo, on that day, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin \nSalul) before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has \nhurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my \nfamily and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to \nenter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop \nhis head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your \norder.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and \nhe was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for \nhis tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not \nand cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' \nOn that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin \n'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the \nbehalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they \nwere about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on \nquietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears \nnever ceasing, and I could never sleep. \nIn the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never \nceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my \nparents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I \nallowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we \nwere in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that \nday of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's \nApostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-andso \nabout you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have \ncommitted a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins \nand asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.462:... ... \nWhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a \nsingle drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning \nwhat he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) .' Then I \nsaid to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By \nAllah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had \na little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech \nso that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you \nthat I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am \ninnocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of \nJoseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is \nAllah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and \nAllah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited \n(forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, \nbut I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, \nby Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine \ninspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \nSo there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him, (when he used to be \ninspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and \nthat was because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When that state of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, he got up smiling, and the first word he said was, 'O `Aisha! Allah has \ndeclared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)). I \nreplied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:- \n- \"Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you.............\" (24.11-20) \nAllah revealed those Qur'anic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to \ndisburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By \nAllah, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.' Then \nAllah revealed:-- \n\"And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their \nkinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's cause, let them pardon and \nforgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" \n(24.22) \nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah forgive me.' and went on giving \nMistah the money he used to give him before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of it \nat all.' \nAisha further said:.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He \nsaid to Zainab, 'What do you know and what did you see?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I refrain \nfrom claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about \n`Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she \nreceived from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna, \nstarted struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man \nwho was blamed said, 'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never uncovered the \ncover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man was martyred in Allah's Cause.\"</b>",

I started throwing arrows at them as I was a good archer and I was saying, \"I am the son of \nAl-Akwa`, and today will perish the wicked people.\" I kept on saying like that till I restored the shecamels \n(of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and \nthe other people came there, and I said, \"O Allah's Prophet! I have stopped the people (of Ghatafan) \nfrom taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people) after them now.\" On that the \nProphet said, \"O the son of Al-Akwa`! You have over-powered them, so forgive them.\" Then we all \ncame back and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) seated me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina.</b>",

While we were proceeding at night, a man \nfrom the group said to 'Amir, \"O 'Amir! Won't you let us hear your poetry?\" 'Amir was a poet, so he \ngot down and started reciting for the people poetry that kept pace with the camels' footsteps, saying:-- \n\"O Allah! Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have \ngiven In charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our \ndefects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon us to make \nour feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An unjust thing, We will \nrefuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others' help Against us.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) on that, \nasked, \"Who is that (camel) driver (reciting poetry)?\" The people said, \"He is 'Amir bin Al-Akwa`.\" \nThen the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"May Allah bestow His Mercy on him.\" A man amongst the people said, \"O \nAllah's Prophet! has (martyrdom) been granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company \nlonger.\" Then we reached and besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah \nhelped the Muslims conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the \nMuslims made huge fires. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What are these fires? For cooking what, are you making \nthe fire?\" The people replied, \"(For cooking) meat.\" He asked, \"What kind of meat?\" They (i.e. \npeople) said, \"The meat of donkeys.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Throw away the meat and break the pots!\" \nSome man said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots instead?\" He \nsaid, \"(Yes, you can do) that too.\" So when the army files were arranged in rows (for the clash), \n'Amir's sword was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword \nreturned to him and injured his own knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the \nbattle, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, \"What is bothering you?\" I \nreplied, \"Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the deeds of 'Amir are \nlost.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever says so, is mistaken, for 'Amir has got a double reward.\" The \nProphet raised two fingers and added, \"He (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of \nAllah and there are few 'Arabs who achieved the like of (good deeds) 'Amir had done.\"</b>",

We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in \nEthiopia. There we met Ja`far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and \nmet the Prophet (ﷺ) at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely \nthe people of the ship, \"We have migrated before you.\" \nAsma' bint 'Umais who was one of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) . She had migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. `Umar came \nto Hafsa while Asma' bint 'Umais was with her. `Umar, on seeing Asma,' said, \"Who is this?\" She \nsaid, \"Asma' bint 'Umais,\" `Umar said, \"Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the sea-faring lady?\" Asma' \nreplied, \"Yes.\" `Umar said, \"We have migrated before you (people of the boat), so we have got more \nright than you over Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \" On that Asma' became angry and said, \"No, by Allah, while you \nwere with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant \nones amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I inform Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nof all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened.

On that, Abu Bakr said, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Our property is not inherited. \nWhatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.' By \nAllah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and will leave it as it \nwas during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and will dispose of it as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do.\" So \nAbu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept \naway from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death \nof the Prophet. When she died, her husband `Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and \nhe said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect `Ali much, \nbut after her death, `Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude towards him. So `Ali sought \nreconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. `Ali had not given the oath of \nallegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death). `Ali \nsent someone to Abu Bakr saying, \"Come to us, but let nobody come with you,\" as he disliked that \n`Umar should come, `Umar said (to Abu Bakr), \"No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone \" \nAbu Bakr said, \"What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them' So Abu Bakr \nentered upon them, and then `Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), \"We know well your \nsuperiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed \nupon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a \nright in it because of our near relationship to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) .\" \nThereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, he said, \"By Him in \nWhose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is dearer to me \nthan to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and \nyou about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any \nrule or regulation which I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) following, in disposing of it, but I will follow.\" On that \n`Ali said to Abu Bakr, \"I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon.\" So when Abu \nBakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then \nmentioned the story of `Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting \nwhat excuses he had offered; Then `Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered \nTashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of \njealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. `Ali added, \"But we used to \nconsider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not \nconsult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry.\" On that all the Muslims became happy \nand said, \"You have done the right thing.\" The Muslims then became friendly with `Ali as he returned \nto what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).</b>",

They would say, \"That man claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been \ndivinely inspired, that Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.\" I used to memorize that (Divine) \nTalk, and feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the 'Arabs (other than Quraish) \ndelayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say.\" \"Leave him (i.e. \nMuhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a true Prophet. So, when \nMecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my father hurried to embrace \nIslam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his \ntribe, he said, \"By Allah, I have come to you from the Prophet (ﷺ) for sure!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) afterwards said \nto them, 'Offer such-and-such prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes \ndue, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who \nknows Qur'an most should, lead the prayer.\" So they looked for such a person and found none who \nknew more Qur'an than I because of the Qur'anic material which I used to learn from the caravans. \nThey therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or seven \nyears, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very short for me (and my body \nbecame partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, \"Won't you cover the anus of your reciter for us?\" \nSo they bought (a piece of cloth) and made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything \nbefore as I was with that shirt.</b>",

On that, one of his \ncompanions said, \"We are more deserving of this (gold) than these (persons).\" When that news \nreached the Prophet (ﷺ) , he said, \"Don't you trust me though I am the truth worthy man of the One in the \nHeavens, and I receive the news of Heaven (i.e. Divine Inspiration) both in the morning and in the \nevening?\" There got up a man with sunken eyes, raised cheek bones, raised forehead, a thick beard, a \nshaven head and a waist sheet that was tucked up and he said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Be afraid of Allah.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Woe to you! Am I not of all the people of the earth the most entitled to fear \nAllah?\" Then that man went away. Khalid bin Al-Wahd said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!

(They will neither understand it nor act upon it).

Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) has not said.\" They said to me, \"We consider you truthful, and we will do what you \nlike.\" The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of them till they came to \nthose who have heard the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wherein he denied them (some animals to ride \non) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same. So these people told them the same \ninformation as Abu Musa had told them.</b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b bin Malik:\n\n<p>Who, from among Ka`b's sons, was the guide of Ka`b when he became blind: I heard Ka`b bin Malik \nnarrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which he failed to take part. Ka`b said, \"I did not \nremain behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed \nto take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, \nfor in fact, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. \nthe Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-`Aqaba \n(pledge) with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr \nbattle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-`Aqaba pledge). As \nfor my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I \nremained behind the Prophet (ﷺ) in that Ghazwa. \nBy Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to \ndifferent Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought in \nsevere heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet (ﷺ) announced \nto the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he \ninformed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was accompanied by a large \nnumber of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.\" Ka`b added, \"Any man who \nintended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it \nthrough Divine Revelation. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had \nripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions prepared for the battle and \nI started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. \nI would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got \nready and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything \nfor my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then \njoin them.' In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned \nhaving done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without \ndoing anything. \nSuch was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I \nintended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the \ndeparture of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining \npersons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those \nweak men whom Allah had excused. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. \nSo while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka`b do?' A man from Banu \nSalama said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his \nlooking at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu`adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you have said! \nBy Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept silent.\" Ka`b \nbin Malik added, \"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was on his way back to Medina. I got \ndipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his \nanger tomorrow?' And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. \nWhen it was said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my \nmind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I \ndecided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned \nfrom a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-rak`at prayer therein and then \nsit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of \nTabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something \nover eighty men; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of \nallegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to \njudge. \nThen I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, \n'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. \nHad you not purchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But by \nAllah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would \nhave avoided his anger with an excuse. \nBy Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I \nknew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me \nin the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah's \nForgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or \nwealthier than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'As regards this man, he \nhas surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu \nSalama followed me and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. \nSurely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as the others who did not join him, have offered. \nThe prayer of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' By Allah, \nthey continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of \nhaving told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' They \nreplied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was \ngiven the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al- \nAmri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had \nattended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change \nmy mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the \nthree aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away \nfrom the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared \nstrange to me as if I did not know it. \nWe remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their \nhouses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go \nout and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would \ntalk to me, and I would come to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering \nafter the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet (ﷺ) did move his lips in return to my greetings \nor not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my \nprayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face \naway from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the \ngarden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to \nhim. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you \nknow that I love Allah and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, \nbut he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle \nknow it better.' Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian \nfarmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to \nKa`b bin Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter \nfrom the king of Ghassan in which the following was written: \n\"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) has treated you harshly. \nAnyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join \nus, and we will console you.\" \nWhen I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' Then I took the letter to the oven and \nmade a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to \nme the messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) orders you to keep away from your \nwife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her \nand do not cohabit her.' The Prophet (ﷺ) sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my \nwife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Hilal bin Umaiya \nis a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' \nHe said, 'No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no \ndesire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.702:... ... \nOn that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to permit your \nwife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I \nwill not ask the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding her, for I do not know What Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that \nstate for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time \nwhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on \nthe 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah \ndescribed (in the Qur'an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow \nto me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala' \ncalling with his loudest voice, 'O Ka`b bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down \nin prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had announced the \nacceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out \nto congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to \nme in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was \nswifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the \ngood tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other \ngarments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's \nApostle. \nThe people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah's Acceptance of my \nrepentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.\" Ka`b further \nsaid, \"When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sitting with the people around him. Talha bin \nUbaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the \nMuhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for \nTalha.\" Ka`b added, \"When I greeted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he, his face being bright with joy, said \"Be \nhappy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.\" Ka`b added, \"I said \nto the Prophet (ﷺ) 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew \nthat characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Because of the acceptance \nof my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's \nApostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share \nfrom Khaibar with me,' and added, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is \na part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone \nof the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that \ntruth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save \nme (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:-- \n\"Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with \nthose who are true (in word and deed).\" (9.117-119) \nBy Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing \nthan the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which would have caused me to perish as those \nwho have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He \never attributed to anybody else. Allah said:-- \"They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you \nwhen you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people-- \n\" (9.95-96) Ka`b added, \"We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's \nApostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to \nforgive them, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for \nthat Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.\" (9.118) \nWhat Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to \nthe deferment of making a decision by the Prophet (ﷺ) about our case in contrast to the case of those who \nhad taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.</b>",
