So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of \nall the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, \nand taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may \nrelieve us from this place of ours.' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).' Then \nAdam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, 'Go to Noah, for he was the first \nApostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.' They will go to him and Noah will say, \n'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no \nknowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, 'Go to the Khalil--r-Rahman (i.e. \nAbraham).' They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the \nslave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .' So they will go to him and he will say, \n'I am not fit for this undertaking.' and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and \nso he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, 'Go to Jesus, Allah's Slave, His \nApostle and Allah's Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, 'I am not fit for this \nundertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.' \nSo they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord's Permission and I will be given \npermission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state \nas long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.' (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your \nrequest will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will \nbe accepted.' I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, \nand then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. \nThen I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And \nthen I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I \nwill come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, 'None \nremains in Hell but those whom the Qur'an has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an \neternal stay in Hell.' \" (The compiler) Abu `Abdullah said: 'But those whom the Qur'an has imprisoned \nin Hell,' refers to the Statement of Allah: \n\"They will dwell therein forever.\" (16.29)</b>",

They - (their wives) -- shall \nwait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days).\" (2.234) \nThe widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband's family, so \nAllah revealed: \"Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, \na year's maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there \nis no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.' (i.e. lawful marriage) \n(2.240). \nSo Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, \nand that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband's home) according \nto the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says: \n\"..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you.\" So the 'Idda \n(i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her. \n'Ata said: Ibn `Abbas said, \"This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: \"..without turning them out..\" \ncancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband's house, and she can \ncomplete this period wherever she likes.\" 'Ata's aid: If she wished, she could complete her 'Idda by \nstaying in her dead husband's residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah's \nStatement:-- \n\"There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves.\" `Ata' added: Later the regulations of \ninheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband's house), \nso she could complete the 'Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her \nwith a residence. Ibn `Abbas said, \"This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow's) dwelling in her dead \nhusband's house and she could complete the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, \nas Allah's Statement says:--\"...without turning them out...\"</b>",

While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet (ﷺ) was brought to \nHeraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded \nit to Heraclius. Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a \nprophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered \nupon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest \nrelative to the man who claims to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my \ncompanions sit behind me. \nThen he called upon his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I \nam going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me \na lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions \nwould consider me a liar, I would have told lies. \nHeraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst \nyou? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.\" \nHeraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' \nHe said, 'Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are increasing.' \nHe said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I \nsaid, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' \nHe said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and \nvictory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties \nupon him.' \nHe said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not \nknow what he will do in it\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a \nword (against him) except that. \nHeraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, \n'No.' \nThen Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), \n'I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family \namongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. \nThen I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought \nthat had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to \nrule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. \nThen I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, \nand you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the \nApostles. \nThen I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and \nyour reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about \nothers, could ever tell a lie about Allah. \nThen I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after \nembracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the \ncheerfulness of the hearts. \nThen I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were \nincreasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. \nThen I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with \nhim and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in \nturns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with \nthe Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. \nThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, \nApostles never betray. \nThen I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon \nI thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a \nman copying some sayings said before him.\" \nAbu Safyan said, \"Heraclius then asked me, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He orders us (to \noffer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.' \nThen Heraclius said, 'If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were \ncertain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; \nand his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and read it wherein was written: \n\"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, \nApostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine........ Peace be upon him who follows the \nRight Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from \nAllah's Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, \nyou will be responsible for the sins of the tillers (i.e. the people of your kingdom) and (Allah's Statement):--\"O the \npeople of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship \nNone but Allah....bear witness that we are Muslims.' (3.64) \nWhen he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, \nand we were ordered to go out.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"While coming out, I said to my companions, \n'The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al14 \nAsfar is afraid of him.' So I continued to believe that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would be victorious, till Allah \nmade me embrace Islam.\" Az-Zuhri said, \"Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and \nhad them assembled in his house and said, 'O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent \nsuccess and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?' (Immediately after hearing \nthat), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, \n'Bring them back to me.' So he called them and said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your \nadherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.' Then the people fell in \nprostration before him and became pleased with him.\" (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)</b>",

He was going to pay visit to Sa`d bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this \nincident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by a gathering in which `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before `Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in \nthat gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers \nand Jews, and in that gathering `Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised \nby the donkey reached that gathering, `Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then \nsaid, \"Do not cover us with dust.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) greeted them and stopped and dismounted and \ninvited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur'an. On that, `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Saluil said, \"O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then \ndo not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody \ncomes to you, relate (your tales) to him.\" On that `Abdullah bin Rawaha said, \"Yes, O Allah's \nApostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that.\" \nSo the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of \nfighting with one another. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the \nProphet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sa`d bin Ubada. The Prophet (ﷺ) said \nto Sa`d, \"Did you not hear what 'Abu Hub-b said?\" He meant `Abdullah bin Ubai. \"He said so-andso.\" \nOn that Sa`d bin Ubada said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who \nrevealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people \nof this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head \n(electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Allah gave to \nyou, he (i.e. `Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have \nseen.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) excused him, for the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions used to forgive the pagans \nand the people of Scripture as Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief \nwith patience. Allah said: \"And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who \nreceived the Scripture before you and from the pagans........'(3.186) And Allah also said:--\"Many of \nthe people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, \nfrom selfish envy..\" (2.109) \nSo the Prophet (ﷺ) used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Allah ordered him to do \nso till Allah permitted fighting them. So when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought the battle of Badr and Allah \nkilled the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who \nwere with him, said, \"This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious).\" So they gave the \npledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and became Muslims.</b>",

But \nwhen there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet (ﷺ) lies and remained behind (the battle of \nTabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be \ndescribed with.

So `Umar kept on \npressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the \nsame opinion as `Umar.\" (Zaid bin Thabit added:) `Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was \nnot speaking. me). \"You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of \nforgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Therefore, look for \nthe Qur'an and collect it (in one manuscript). \" By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one \nof the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me \nconcerning the collection of the Qur'an. I said to both of them, \"How dare you do a thing which the \nProphet has not done?\" Abu Bakr said, \"By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with \nhim about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and \n`Umar. So I started locating Qur'anic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks \nof date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuza`ima two \nVerses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):-- \n\"Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that \nyou should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be \nrightly guided)\" (9.128) \nThe manuscript on which the Qur'an was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him unto \nHim, and then with `Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, `Umar's \ndaughter.</b>",

You art Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Allah gave you \nsuperiority above the others with this message and with His direct Talk to you; (please) intercede for \nus with your Lord Don't you see in what state we are?' Moses will say, 'My Lord has today become \nangry as He has never become before, nor will become thereafter, I killed a person whom I had not \nbeen ordered to kill. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.' \nSo they will go to Jesus and say, 'O Jesus! You are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and His Word which He sent to \nMary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. \nPlease intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?' Jesus will say. 'My Lord \nhas today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will \nnot mention any sin, but will say, 'Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.' \nSo they will come to me and say, 'O Muhammad ! You are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the last of the \nprophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don't \nyou see in what state we are?\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then I will go beneath Allah's Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. \nAnd then Allah will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided \nanybody else before me. Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be \ngranted. Intercede and It (your intercession) will be accepted.' So I will raise my head and Say, 'My \nfollowers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord'. It will be said, 'O Muhammad! Let those of your \nfollowers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; \nand they will share the other gates with the people.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further said, \"By Him in Whose \nHand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between \nMecca and Busra (in Sham).</b>",

Moses \nreplied, 'I (am the most learned).' Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allah \nalone. So Allah revealed to him: 'At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more \nlearned than you.' Moses asked, 'O my Lord, how can I meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and put it \nin a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.' So Moses (took a fish \nand put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached a \nrock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got \nout of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) \nAllah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was \nlike a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried \non their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night. \nThe next morning Moses asked his boy-servant 'Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered \nmuch fatigue in this journey of ours.' (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place \nwhich Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,' 'Do you remember when \nwe be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember \nit. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.' (18.63) \nThere was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, \n'That is what we have been seeking'. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both \nreturned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered \nwith a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. 'Is there such a greeting in your \nland?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' He said, 'Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?' Moses said, 'I \nhave come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught. \nAl-Khadir said, 'You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of \nAllah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some \nof Allah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.\" Moses said, \"Allah \nwilling, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.' (18.6) Al-Khadir said to \nhim. 'If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' \n(18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested \nthe crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board \nfree of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the \nplanks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.' These people gave us a free lift, yet you have \nscuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.' (18.71) \nAl-Khadir said, 'Didn't I say that you can have no patience with me ?' (18.72) Moses said, 'Call me not \nto account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)\" (18.73) \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow \ncame and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, \n'My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah's knowledge is like what this sparrow has \ntaken out of the sea.' Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, \nAl-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it \nout with his hands and killed him. Moses said, 'Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed \nnobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.' (18.74) He said, \"Didn't I tell you that you can have no \npatience with me?' (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) \nMoses said, 'If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received \nan excuse from me.' (18.76) \nThen they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they \nrefused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) \nAl-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, 'These are people to whom we came, but \nthey neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some \nrecompense for it. Al-Khadir said, 'This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation \nof (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.' (18.78-82) \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Allah might have \ndescribed to us more about their story.\"</b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\r\nNarrated Ibn Juraij:\r\n\r\n<p>Ya`la bin Muslim and `Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Sa`id bin Jubair. \r\nNarrated Sa`id: While we were at the house of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ask me (any question)\" I \r\nsaid, \"O Abu `Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a storyteller \r\ncalled Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir's companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.\" As for \r\n`Amr, he said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, \"(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.\" But Ya`la said to me, \r\n\"Ibn `Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka`b said, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Once Moses, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), preached to \r\nthe people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. \r\nThen a man came to Moses and asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is there anyone on the earth who is more \r\nlearned than you?' Moses replied, 'No.' So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all \r\nknowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), 'Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more \r\nthan you ).' Moses said, 'O my Lord! Where is he?' Allah said, 'At the junction of the two seas.' Moses \r\nsaid, 'O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.' \" `Amr said to me, Allah \r\nsaid, \"That place will be where the fish will leave you.\" Ya`la said to me, \"Allah said (to Moses), \r\n'Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.' \" So Moses took a fish \r\nand put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant \"I don't want to trouble you, except that you should \r\ninform me as soon as this fish leaves you.\" He said (to Moses).\" You have not demanded too much.\" \r\nAnd that is as mentioned by Allah: \r\n'And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant .... ' (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state \r\nthat). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish \r\nslipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but \r\nwhen he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the \r\nflow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming \r\na hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a \r\nrock.\" \r\nMoses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). \r\nThen they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found \r\nhim) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end \r\nunder his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said \r\nastonishingly, 'Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' Al- \r\nKhadir said, 'Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes.' Al-Khadir said, \"What do you \r\nwant?' Moses said, ' I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.' Al- \r\nKhadir said, 'Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration \r\ncomes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a \r\nknowledge which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: \r\nAl-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like \r\nwhat this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). \r\nThey found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The \r\ncrew recognized Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious slave of Allah.' (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" \r\nHe said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, 'We will not get him on board with fare.' Al-Khadir scuttled the \r\nboat and then plugged the hole with a piece of wood. \r\nMoses said, 'Have you scuttled it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. \r\n(18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didn't I say that you can have no \r\npatience with me?' (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forgetfulness, the second \r\ncaused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done intentionally. Moses said, 'Call \r\nme not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).' (18.73) \r\n(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said 'They found boys playing \r\nand Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses \r\nsaid, 'Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody' (18.74) Then they proceeded and found \r\na wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight. Sa`id moved his hand \r\nthus and said 'Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, 'I think Sa`id said, \r\n'Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), 'If you \r\nhad wished, you could have taken wages for it.' Sa`id said, 'Wages that we might had eaten.' And there \r\nwas a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: 'In \r\nfront of them (was) a king.' \r\nIt is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say \r\nthat the boy was called Haisur. 'A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that \r\nboat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would \r\nrepair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some \r\nsaid with tar. 'His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we (Khadir) feared \r\nlest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.' (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him \r\nwould urge them to follow him in his religion, 'so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change \r\nhim for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy' (18:81). This was in reply to Moses' \r\nsaying: Have you killed an innocent soul.'? (18.74). 'Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful \r\nto him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa`id, said that they were \r\ncompensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi `Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next \r\nchild was a girl.</b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Sa`id bin Jubair:\n\n<p>I said to Ibn `Abbas, \"Nauf-al-Bakali \" claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the \ncompanion of Al-Khadir.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah's enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka`b narrated to us \nthat Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, 'Who \nis the most learned person among the people?' Moses replied, 'I (am the most learned).' Allah then \nadmonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine \nInspiration:-- 'Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.' \nMoses said, 'O my Lord ! How can meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish in a basket and wherever the \nfish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant \nYusha` bin Noon, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses \nput his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than `Amr said) 'At the \nrock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with its water but became \nalive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket \nand entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early meal' (18.62). \nThe narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had \nbeen ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha` bin Noon said to him, 'Do you remember (what \nhappened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish ...' (18.63) The \nnarrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the \nfish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for \nthe fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. \nThe man said astonishingly, 'Is there any such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The \nman said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes,' and added, 'may I follow you so that you teach me \nsomething of the Knowledge which you have been taught?' (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, 'O Moses! \nYou have something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I \nhave something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.' Moses \nsaid, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then if you follow me, ask me no question about \nanything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along \nthe seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on \nboard free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and \ndipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. 'My knowledge and your knowledge and all the \ncreation's knowledge compared to Allah's knowledge is not more than the water taken by this \nsparrow's beak.' \nThen Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses \nsaid to him, 'These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown \nthem. Surely you have...' (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other \nboys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, 'Have you killed an \ninnocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! ' (18.74) He said, \n\"Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain \nthem as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.' (18.75-77) Al-Khadir \nmoved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, 'When we entered this town, \nthey neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,' Al- \nKhadir said, 'This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) \nabout which you were unable to hold patience.'...(18.78) \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could \nhave described to us more about their story.' Ibn `Abbas used to recite:-- 'And in front (ahead) of them \nthere was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) ...and as for the boy he \nwas a disbeliever. \"</b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Aisha:\n\n<p>(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots \namong his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots \nwhen he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah's \nApostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my \nhowdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah's \nApostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered to \nproceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked \non till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my \nhowdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I \nlooked for it and my search for it detained me. \nThe group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel \non which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and \nwere not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the \nhowdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. \nThen I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I \nwent to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. \nWhile I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh- \nDhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing \nplace in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on \nseeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna \nilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, \nhe did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel \nkneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading \nthe she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot \nmidday. \nThen whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged \nstatement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one \nmonth while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not \naware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer \nreceiving from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \nThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my \nailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where \nwe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and \nthat was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit \nof the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we \nconsidered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah \nwho was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir \nwho was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished \nour affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe \nwhereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you \nabuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what \nhe has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk \n(forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, \nand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At \nthat time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) allowed me and I went to my \nparents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \n\"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband \nwho has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! \nDid the people really talk about that?\" \nThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, \nand morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin \nZaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. \nUsama bin Zaid told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his \naffection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She is your wife, and we do not know anything \nabout her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not impose \nrestrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, \nshe will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did \nyou ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By \nAllah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would \nblame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of \nher family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" \nSo Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge \non `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who \nwill help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing \nexcept good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, \nand he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I \nwill chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we \nwill obey it.\" \nOn that, Sa`d bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had \nbeen a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah \nthe Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, \nUsaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar! \nBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So \nthe two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each \nother while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued quietening them till \nthey became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that \nneither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept \nfor two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would \nburst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission \nto see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's \nApostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, \nwas said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I \nhave been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your \ninnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him, for \nwhen a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allah's \nApostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop \nthereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \n\"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's \nApostle.\" \nShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had \nlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so \nthat it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am \ninnocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, \nand Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an \nexample except that of Joseph's father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you \nassert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and \nat that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited \n(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be \nrecited: but I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a vision in which Allah would prove my \ninnocence. By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the \nDivine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . So there overtook him the same hard condition which \nused to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running \ndown, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the \nStatement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, and he was \nsmiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" \nMy mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not \nthank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among \nyou. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). \nWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for \nMistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never \nprovide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \n\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, \nthose in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive \n(i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. \nMost Merciful.\" (24.22) \nAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the \naid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha \nfurther said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What \nhave you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining \nfrom telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), it was \nZainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her \n(from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she \nwas destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.</b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\r\nNarrated Aisha:\r\n\r\n<p>When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up \r\nand addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He \r\ndeserved, he said, \"To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a \r\nforged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused \r\nher of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my \r\nhouse unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.\" Sa`d bin \r\nMu`adh got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Allow me to chop their heads off\". \r\nThen a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa`d bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin \r\nThabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sa`d bin Mu`adh), \"You have told a lie! By Allah, if those \r\npersons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.\" It was probable that \r\nsome evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all \r\nthat. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um \r\nMistah was accompanying me. \r\nOn our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, \"Let Mistah. be ruined\" I said to her, \"O mother Why do \r\nyou abuse your Son\" On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, \r\n\"Let Mistah be ruined\" I said to her, \"Why do you abuse your son?\" She stumbled for the third time \r\nand said, \"Let Mistah be ruined\" whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, \"By Allah, I do not abuse \r\nhim except because of you.\" I asked her, \"Concerning what of my affairs?\" So she disclosed the whole \r\nstory to me. I said, \"Has this really happened?\" She replied, \"Yes, by Allah.\" I returned to my house, \r\nastonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. \r\nThen I became sick (fever) and said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \"Send me to my father's house.\" So he sent a \r\nslave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my \r\nfather) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, \"What has brought you, O (my) \r\ndaughter?\" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She \r\nsaid, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has \r\nother wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.\" But she did not feel the news as I \r\ndid. I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said, \"yes\" I asked, Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \r\nknow about it too?\" She said, \"Yes, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) does too.\" So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. \r\nAbu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is \r\nthe matter with her? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of \r\nAl-lfk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to \r\nyour home\". \r\nI went back to my home and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about \r\nme (my character). The maid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character \r\nexcept that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the \r\nProphet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Finally they \r\ntold her of the affair (of the slander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her \r\nexcept what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.\" Then this news reached the man who was \r\naccused, and he said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any \r\nwoman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. \r\nNext morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to \r\nme after he had offered the `Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on \r\nmy right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, \"Now then O `Aisha! If you have \r\ncommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the \r\nrepentance from his slaves.\" An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to \r\nthe Prophet). \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's \r\nApostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my \r\nbehalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer \r\nhim. She said, \"What should I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, \"I \r\ntestify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" \r\nAnd after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell \r\nyou that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would \r\nnot be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have \r\nabsorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, \r\nthen you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty.\" By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example for me \r\nand you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he \r\nsaid; So (for me) \"Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help \r\ncan be sought.' \r\nAt that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we remained silent. Then the \r\nInspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the \r\nsweat) from his forehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O ' \"Aisha! Allah has revealed your \r\ninnocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \r\n\"By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who \r\nhas revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to \r\ndefend me),\" (Aisha used to say:) \"But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah \r\nprotected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, \r\nHamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were \r\nMistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, `Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and \r\ntempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took \r\nan oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse: \r\n\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of \r\nhelp) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive \r\nyou? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \r\nOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.\" So Abu \r\nBakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.</b>",

Allah said to His \nprophet. 'Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur'an), nor I am one of the \npretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)'

Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.' So they were \nafflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and \nbones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe \nhunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, \"O Muhammad! You came to order us for \nto keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke \nAllah (to relieve them).' Then Ibn Mas`ud recited:-- 'Then watch you for the day that the sky will \nbring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible....but truly you will return!

So Allah (threatened them thus): 'On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.' \n(44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr.

When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its \nportents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its \nportents.

If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain \nmatter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you.\" Then `Umar added, \"By Allah, in \nthe Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding \nthem what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was \nthinking over a certain matter, my wife said, \"I recommend that you do so-and-so.\" I said to her, \n\"What have you got to do with the is matter?

Do you argue with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so that he remains angry the whole day?\" H. afsa \nsaid, \"By Allah, we argue with him.\" `Umar said, \"Know that I warn you of Allah's punishment and \nthe anger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . . . O my daughter! Don't be betrayed by the one who is proud of her \nbeauty because of the love of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for her (i.e. `Aisha).\" `Umar addled, \"Then I went out to \nUm Salama's house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It \nis rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allah's \nApostle and his wives!' By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. \nI left her (and went home). \nAt that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my \nabsence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the \nkings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts \nbecause of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, \"Open \nOpen!' I said, 'Has the king of Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but something worse; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has \nisolated himself from his wives.' I said, 'Let the nose of `Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. \nhumiliated)!' Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)'s residence, and behold, he was \nstaying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwas (sitting) on the first step. \nI said to him, 'Say (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ) `Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) admitted me and I \nnarrated the story to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When I reached the story of Um Salama, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled \nwhile he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. \nUnderneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were \npiled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted \non his side, I wept. He said.' 'Why are you weeping?' I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Caesar and \nKhosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) though you are, is living in \ndestitute\". The Prophet (ﷺ) then replied.

As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, \nhe is the one who ties it for Allah's Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then, \nwhatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its \nrope and jumps over one or two hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be \nwritten for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water though its owner had no intention to \nwater it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a \nsource of) reward for such a man. \nIf a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from asking others for help and he does \nnot forget Allah's right, i.e. pays its Zakat and gives it to be used in Allah's Cause, then that horse will \nbe a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of pride and to show off and to excite others, \nthen that horse will be a burden (of sins) for him.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was asked regarding donkeys. \nHe replied, \"Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive Verse which includes \neverything: \n'So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; and whoever \ndoes evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.'

Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira \nwhere he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take \nthe necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his \nprovision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. \nAn Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"I do not know how to read.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. \nThen he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' \nThereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released \nme and asked me to read, but again I replied. 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he held me for \nthe third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, 'Read, in the \nName of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your \nLord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he \nknew not.\" (96.1-5). \nThen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders \nwere trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, \"Cover me!\" They covered him, and \nwhen the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, \"O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid \nthat something bad might happen to me.\" Then he told her the story. Khadija said, \"Nay! But receive \nthe good tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you keep good relations with \nyour Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously \nand assist those who are stricken with calamities.\" Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the \nson of Khadija's paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period \nand used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He \nwas an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), \"O my cousin! Listen to what \nyour nephew is going to say.\" Waraqa said, \"O my nephew! What have you seen?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then \ndescribed whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, \"This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to \nMoses. I wish I were young.\" He added some other statement. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Will these \npeople drive me out?\" Waraqa said, \"Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but \nwas treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I \nwould support you strongly.\" But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was \npaused (stopped) for a while so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was very much grieved.</b>",
