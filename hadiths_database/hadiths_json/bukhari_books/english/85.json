May I admit them? `Umar said, 'Yes.' So he \nadmitted them Then he came again and said, 'May I admit `Ali and `Abbas?' He said, 'Yes.' `Abbas \nsaid, 'O, chief of the believers!

And by that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) meant himself.' The group said, '(No doubt), he said \nso.' `Umar then faced `Ali and `Abbas and said, 'Do you both know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said that?' \nThey replied, '(No doubt), he said so.' `Umar said, 'So let me talk to you about this matter. Allah \nfavored His Apostle with something of this Fai' (i.e. booty won by the Muslims at war without \nfighting) which He did not give to anybody else; \nAllah said:-- 'And what Allah gave to His Apostle ( Fai' Booty) .........to do all things....(59.6) And so \nthat property was only for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . Yet, by Allah, he neither gathered that property for \nhimself nor withheld it from you, but he gave its income to you, and distributed it among you till there \nremained the present property out of which the Prophet (ﷺ) used to spend the yearly maintenance for his \nfamily, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah's property is spent (i.e. in charity \netc.). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) followed that throughout his life. \nNow I beseech you by Allah, do you know all that?' They said, 'Yes.' `Umar then said to `Ali and \n`Abbas, 'I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?' Both of them said, 'Yes.' `Umar added, 'And \nwhen the Prophet (ﷺ) died, Abu Bakr said, ' I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and took charge of that \nproperty and managed it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did. \nThen I took charge of this property for two years during which I managed it as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and \nAbu Bakr did. Then you both (`Ali and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and \npresenting the same case. (O `Abbas!) You came to me asking for your share from the property of \nyour nephew, and this man (Ali) came to me, asking for the share of h is wife from the property of her \nfather. I said, 'If you both wish, I will give that to you on that condition (i.e. that you would follow the \nway of the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr and as I (`Umar) have done in man aging it).' Now both of you seek \nof me a verdict other than that? Lo! By Allah, by Whose permission both the heaven and the earth \nexist, I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established.
