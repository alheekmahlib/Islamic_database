Will you lead the \npeople in prayer?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"Yes, if you wish.\" So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu \nBakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came piercing \nthrough the rows till he stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would \nnever look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and \nsaw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised \nAllah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went forward and led the people in the \nprayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, \"O people! Why did you \nstart clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one \nis confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, 'Sub Han Allah'.\" Then the \nProphet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, \"What prevented you from leading the prayer when I \nbeckoned you to carry on?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the \nprayer in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).</b>",
