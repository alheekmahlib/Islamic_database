        "hadithText": "<p>\n\n     Narrated Abu Huraira:\n<p>\n\n     The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"An Israeli man asked another Israeli to lend him \n     one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former \n     replied, 'Allah is sufficient as a witness.' The second said, 'I want \n     a surety.' The former replied, 'Allah is sufficient as a surety.' The \n     second said, 'You are right,' and lent him the money for a certain \n     period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished his job, he \n     searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the \n     repayment of the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece \n     of wood and made a hole in it, inserted in it one thousand Dinars and \n     a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole tightly.\n     He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. 'O Allah! You know well\n     that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded \n     a surety from me but I told him that Allah's Guarantee was sufficient \n     and he accepted Your guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told\n     him that Allah was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a \n     Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could \n     pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.' \n     Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out \n     far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started searching for\n     a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country. \n<p>\n\n     One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had \n     arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of \n     wood in which his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for\n     fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it. \n     Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one thousand Dinars to \n     him and said, 'By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that \n     I could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I \n     have come by.' The lender asked, 'Have you sent something to me?' The \n     debtor replied, 'I have told you I could not get a boat other than the\n     one I have come by.' The lender said, 'Allah has delivered on your \n     behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your \n     one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.' \"\n<p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Aisha:\n\n<p>(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could remember things, I have seen my parents \nworshipping according to the right faith of Islam. Not a single day passed but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) visited \nus both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for \nEthiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the \nchief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, \"Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr said, \"My people \nhave turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad- \nDaghna said, \"A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their \nliving, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide \nguests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back \nand worship your Lord at your home.\" Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the \nchiefs of Quraish saying to them, \"A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do \nyou turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps \nthe disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?\" \nSo, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna's guarantee of protection and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, \nand said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, \"Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read \nwhat he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and \nwomen may follow him.\" Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued \nworshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Qur'an aloud except in his house. Later \non Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and \nstarted praying and reciting Qur'an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started \ngathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could \nnot help weeping while reciting Qur'an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn \nAd-Daghna and when he came, they said, \"We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he \nwill worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in \nthe court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur'an in public. We are afraid lest he \nmislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his \nLord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to \nbetray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr's public declaration of Islam (his \nworshipping). \n`Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, \"You know the conditions on which I gave \nyou protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not \nlike to hear the 'Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his \npeople did not respect it.\" Abu Bakr said, \"I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with \nAllah's protection.\" At that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, \n\"Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and \nsituated between two mountains which are the two ,Harras.\" So, when the Prophet (ﷺ) told it, some of the \ncompanions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. \nWhen Abu Bakr prepared for emigration, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, \"Wait, for I expect to be \npermitted to emigrate.\" Abu Bakr asked, \"May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really \nexpect that?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his departure in order \nto accompany Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for \nfour months.</b>",
