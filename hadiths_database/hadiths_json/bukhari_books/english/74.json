We had no water with us except a \nlittle which was put in a vessel and was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) . He put his hand into it and spread out \nhis fingers and then said, \"Come along! Hurry up! All those who want to perform ablution. The \nblessing is from Allah.'' I saw the water gushing out from his fingers. So the people performed the \nablution and drank, and I tried to drink more of that water (beyond my thirst and capacity), for I knew \nthat it was a blessing. The sub-narrator said: I asked Jabir, \"How many persons were you then?\" He \nreplied, \"We were one-thousand four hundred men.\" Salim said: Jabir said, 1500.</b>",
