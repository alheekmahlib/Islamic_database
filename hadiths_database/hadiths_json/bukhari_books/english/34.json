So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I \nsat in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower her except \nrightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Allah! If You regard that I did if for Your sake, \nkindly remove this rock.' So, two-thirds of the rock was removed. Then the third man said, 'O Allah! \nNo doubt You know that once I employed a worker for one Faraq (three Sa's) of millet, and when I \nwanted to pay him, he refused to take it, so I sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and a \nshepherd. After a time that man came and demanded his money. I said to him: Go to those cows and \nthe shepherd and take them for they are for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told \nhim that I was not joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You regard that I did it \nsincerely for Your sake, then please remove the rock.'

Abraham replied, 'She is my sister (i.e. in religion).' \nThen Abraham returned to her and said, 'Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them \nthat you are my sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.' Then \nAbraham sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed \nand said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private parts from \neverybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' On that the king fell \nin a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the king, Sarah said, 'O \nAllah! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.' The king regained his power, and \nproceeded towards her but she got up again and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O Allah! If I \nhave believed in You and Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except my \nhusband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' The king again fell in a mood of agitation \nand started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the \npeople will say that I have killed him.' The king got either two or three attacks, and after recovering \nfrom the last attack he said, 'By Allah! You have sent a satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her \nAjar.' So she came back to Abraham and said, 'Allah humiliated the pagan and gave us a slave-girl for \nservice.\"</b>",
