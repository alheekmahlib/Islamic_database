Do you hope that (emigration)?\" The \nProphet said, 'Yes.\" So Abu Bakr waited to accompany the Prophet (ﷺ) and fed two she-camels he had on \nthe leaves of As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting in our house at \nmidday, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"Here is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), coming with his head and a part of his \nface covered with a cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us.\" \nAbu Bakr said, \"Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An urgent matter must \nhave brought you here at this hour.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) came and asked the permission to enter, and he was \nallowed. The Prophet (ﷺ) entered and said to Abu Bakr, \"Let those who are with you, go out.\" Abu Bakr \nreplied, \"(There is no stranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's \nApostle!\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I have been allowed to leave (Mecca).\" Abu Bakr said, \" I shall accompany you, O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ), Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes,\" \nAbu Bakr said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s! Let my father be sacrificed for you. Take one of these two shecamels \nof mine\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said. I will take it only after paying its price.\" \nSo we prepared their baggage and put their journey food In a leather bag. And Asma' bint Abu Bakr \ncut a piece of her girdle and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why she was called Dhatan- \nNitaqaln. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr went to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained \nthere for three nights. `Abdullah bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with \nthem at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as \nif he had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the \nProphet and Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. \n'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he \nused to take those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the `Isha prayer. They would sleep \nsoundly till 'Amir bin Fuhaira awakened them when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of \nthose three nights.</b>",

I \nsaid to her, 'Strange! You can retort in this way?' She said, 'Yes. Do you say this to me while your \ndaughter troubles Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' So I went to Hafsa and said to her, 'I warn you not to disobey \nAllah and His Apostle.' I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to \nme, 'O `Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose \neven into the affairs of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his wives.' So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari \nman; whenever he was absent from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I was present there, I used to convey to him \nwhat had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey \nto me what had happened as regards news from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . \nDuring that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) except the king \nof Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and \nsaid, 'A great event has happened!' I asked him, 'What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?' He said, \n'Greater than that! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them \nweeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet (ﷺ) had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the \nroom there was a slave to whom I went and said, \"Ask the permission for me to enter.\" He admitted \nme and I entered to see the Prophet (ﷺ) lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head \nthere was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and \nsome grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply \nUm Salama had given me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then \ncame down.\" (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)</b>",
