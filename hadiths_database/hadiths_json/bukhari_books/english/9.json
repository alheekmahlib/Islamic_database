The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the \nguests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to \nour fill and the food was more than it was before its serving. \nAbu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He \naddressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my \neyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, 'That \n(oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it \nand then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty \nbetween us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet (ﷺ) divided us \ninto twelve (groups) (the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man.
