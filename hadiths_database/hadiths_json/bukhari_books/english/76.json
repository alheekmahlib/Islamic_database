Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he \nwas given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain.

But. by Allah, we wanted you to \nreceive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us \nsomething as wages.\" Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The man \nwent with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha \ntill the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paid \nthem their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet's companions) said, \"Distribute \n(the sheep).\" But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, \"Do not do that till we go to Allah's \nApostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us.\" So they came to \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned the story to him and he said, \"How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is \na Ruqya?
