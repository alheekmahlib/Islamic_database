Had this interpretation of \nyours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not \nperform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar \nwho used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called \"Manat\" which they used to worship at a \nplace called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), \nwould consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. \nWhen they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, \"O Allah's \nApostle!

We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has \nrevealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka`ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there \nany harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Allah revealed: \"Verily As-Safa and Al- \nMarwa are among the symbols of Allah.\" Abu Bakr said, \"It seems that this verse was revealed \nconcerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre- \nIslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam \nthey refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not \nmention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka`ba.'</b>",

When we reached Makkah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Give up your intention of doing the Hajj (at this moment) and perform 'Umra, except the one who had garlanded the Hady.\" So, we performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and [Sa'y] between As-safa and Al-MArwa, slept with our wives and wore ordinary (stitched) clothes. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"Whoever has garlanded his Hady is not allowed to finish the Ihram till the Hady has reached its destination (has been sacrificed)\". Then on the night of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijjah, in the afternoon) he ordered us to assume Ihram for Hajj and when we have performed all the ceremonies of Hajj, we came and performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and (Sa'y) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa, and then our Hajj was complete, and we had to sacrifice a Hady according to the statement of Allah: \n<br><br>\n\"... He must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observer Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home)….\" (V. 2:196).\n<br><br>\nAnd the sacrifice of the sheep is sufficient. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions joined the two religious deeds, (i.e. Hajj and 'Umra) in one year, for Allah revealed (the permissibility) of such practice in His book and in the Sunna (legal ways) of His Prophet (ﷺ) and rendered it permissible for all the people except those living in Makkah. Allah says: \"This is for him whose family is not present at the Al-Masjid-Al-Haram, (i.e. non resident of Makkah).\" The months of Hajj which Allah mentioned in His book are: Shawwal, Dhul-Qa'da and Dhul-Hijjah. Whoever performed Hajj-at-Tamattu' in those months, then slaughtering or fasting is compulsory for him.\n<br><br>\nThe words: 1. Ar-Rafatha means sexual intercourse. 2. Al-Fasuq means all kinds of sin, and 3. Al-Jidal means to dispute.</b>",
