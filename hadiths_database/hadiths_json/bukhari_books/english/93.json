So you should search for \nthe fragmentary scripts of the Qur'an and collect it (in one Book).\" Zaid further said: By Allah, if Abu \nBakr had ordered me to shift a mountain among the mountains from one place to another it would not \nhave been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur'an. Then I said (to `Umar and Abu \nBakr), \"How can you do something which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not do?\" Abu Bakr said, \"By Allah, it is \nsomething beneficial.\" Zaid added: So he (Abu Bakr) kept on pressing me for that until Allah opened \nmy chest for that for which He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and `Umar, and I had in that \nmatter, the same opinion as theirs. \nSo I started compiling the Qur'an by collecting it from the leafless stalks of the date-palm tree and \nfrom the pieces of leather and hides and from the stones, and from the chests of men (who had \nmemorized the Qur'an). I found the last verses of Sirat-at-Tauba: (\"Verily there has come unto you an \nApostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves--' (9.128-129) ) from Khuza`ima or Abi Khuza`ima \nand I added to it the rest of the Sura.

The eldest!\" meaning, \"Let the \neldest of you speak.\" So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then Muhaiyisa. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The Jews \nshould either pay the blood money of your (deceased) companion or be ready for war.\" After that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) wrote a letter to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote that they had not killed him. \nThen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Huwaiyisa, Muhaiyisa and `Abdur-Rahman, \"Can you take an oath by \nwhich you will be entitled to take the blood money?\" They said, \"No.\" He said (to them), \"Shall we \nask the Jews to take an oath before you?\" They replied, \"But the Jews are not Muslims.\" So Allah's \nApostle gave them one-hundred she-camels as blood money from himself.
