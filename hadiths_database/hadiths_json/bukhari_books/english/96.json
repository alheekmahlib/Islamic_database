O \n`Asim! Please ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about this matter on my behalf.\" `Asim asked the Prophet (ﷺ) but the \nProphet disliked the question and disapproved of it. `Asim returned and informed 'Uwaimir that the \nProphet disliked that type of question. 'Uwaimir said, \"By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet.\" \n'Uwaimir came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when Allah had already revealed Qur'anic Verses (in that respect), after \n`Asim had left (the Prophet (ﷺ) ). So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to 'Uwaimir, \"Allah has revealed Qur'anic Verses \nregarding you and your wife.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then called for them, and they came and carried out the \norder of Lian. \nThen 'Uwaimir said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a \nlie.\" So 'Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet (ﷺ) did not order him to do so. Later on this practice \nof divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li'an. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to the \npeople). \"Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then \nI will be of the opinion that he ('Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with \nbig buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her.\" 'Ultimately she gave \nbirth to a child that proved the accusation.

Do you know that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in \ncharity,' and by this Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) meant himself?\" On that the group said, \"He verily said so.\" \n`Umar then faced `Ali and `Abbas and said, \"I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said so?\" They both replied, \"Yes\". `Umar then said, \"Now I am talking to you about \nthis matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with some of this wealth which He did not give \nto anybody else, as Allah said: 'What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you \nmade no expedition...

The Prophet (ﷺ) did so \nduring all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?\" They replied, \"Yes.\" `Umar \nthen addressed `Ali and `Abbas, saying, \"I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?\" Both of \nthem replied, \"Yes.\" `Umar added, \"Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said 'I am \nthe successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)' and took over all the Prophet's property and disposed of it in the \nsame way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and you were present then.\" Then he turned to `Ali and \n`Abbas and said, \"You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah \nknows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it. \nThen Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, 'I said: I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr.' So \nI took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and Abu \nBakr used to do. Then you both (`Ali and `Abbas) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O \n`Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew's property; and this (`Ali) came to me \nasking for his wives share from her father's property, and I said to you both, 'If you wish, I will place \nit in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and \nAbu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to \nme anymore about it.' \nThen you both said, 'Give it to us on that (condition).' So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I \nbeseech you by Allah, did I not give it to them on that condition?\" The group (whom he had been \naddressing) replied, \"Yes.\" `Umar then addressed `Abbas and `Ali saying, \"I beseech you both by \nAllah, didn't I give you all that property on that condition?\" They said, \"Yes.\" `Umar then said, \"Are \nyou now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and \nthe Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both \nare unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on \nyour behalf.\" (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)</b>",

He wanted to ask them and consult \nthem about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew \nabout my innocence, but `Ali said, \"Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women \nother than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) \nasked Barira (my salve girl), \"Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?\" She replied, \n\"I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family \n(unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) stood on the pulpit and said, \n\"O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By \nAllah, I know nothing about my family except good.\" The narrator added: Then the Prophet (ﷺ) \nmentioned the innocence of `Aisha. (See Hadith No. 274, Vol. 6)</b>",
