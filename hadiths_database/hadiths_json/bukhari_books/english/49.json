The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and said to them, \"I have other people with me in this \nmatter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the \nproperties or the prisoners as I have delayed their distribution.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) had waited for them for \nmore than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became evident to them that the Prophet (ﷺ) \nwas not going to return them except one of the two, they said, \"We choose our prisoners.\" The \nProphet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and said, \"Then \nafter, these brethren of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical to return them the \ncaptives. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you \nlikes to stick to his share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will give \nus, then he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives).\" The people unanimously said, \"We do that \n(return the captives) willingly.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"We do not know which of you has agreed to it and \nwhich have not, so go back and let your leaders forward us your decision.\" So, all the people then \nwent back and discussed the matter with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet (ﷺ) that all \nthe people had willingly given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us about \nthe captives of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that `Abbas said to the Prophet, \"I paid for my ransom and \n`Aqil's ransom.\"</b>",
