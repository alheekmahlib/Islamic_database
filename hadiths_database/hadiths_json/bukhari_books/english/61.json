We heard that a man had appeared in \nMecca, claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, 'Go to that man and talk to him and bring me \nhis news.' He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, 'What is the news with you?' He said, 'By \nAllah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.' I said to him, 'You have not \nsatisfied me with this little information.' So, I took a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards \nMecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. \nI Kept on drinking Zam zam water and staying in the Mosque. Then `Ali passed by me and said, 'It \nseems you are a stranger?' I said, 'Yes.' He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did \nhe ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the \nProphet but no-one told me anything about him. `Ali passed by me again and asked, 'Hasn't the man \nrecognized his dwelling place yet' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Come along with me.' He asked me, 'What is \nyour business? What has brought you to this town?' \nI said to him, 'If you keep my secret, I will tell you.' He said, 'I will do,' I said to him, 'We have heard \nthat a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. \nI sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I \nthought of meeting him personally.' `Ali said (to Abu Dhar), 'You have reached your goal; I am going \nto him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may \ncause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you \nshould go away then.' `Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with \nhim to the Prophet (ﷺ) to whom I said, 'Present (the principles of) Islam to me.' When he did, I embraced \nIslam 'immediately. \nHe said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you \nhear of our victory, return to us. ' I said, 'By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce \nmy conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),' Abu Dhar went to the Mosque, \nwhere some people from Quraish were present, and said, 'O folk of Quraish ! I testify that None has \nthe right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah's Slave and His \nApostle.' (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, 'Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !' They got up and beat \nme nearly to death. Al `Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them \nand said, 'Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your \ncommunications are through the territory of Ghifar?' They therefore left me. The next morning I \nreturned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, 'Get at \nthis Sabi!' I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found me and \nthrew himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before.' So, that \nwas the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to Islam.\"</b>",

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him. We \nhad become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a lady \n(riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her, \"Where can we get \nwater?\" She replied, \"Oh !

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a \nclosed door between you and them.\" `Umar asked, \"Will that door be opened or broken?\" Hudhaifa \nreplied, \"No, it will be broken.\" `Umar said, \"Then it is very likely that the door will not be closed \nagain.\" Later on the people asked Hudhaifa, \"Did `Umar know what that door meant?\" He said. \"Yes, \n`Umar knew it as everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning.

They recite Qur'an but it does not go beyond their throats (i.e. they \ndo not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an arrow goes through a victim's body, so that the \nhunter, on looking at the arrow's blade, would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see \nnothing: he would look at its Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see \nnothing (neither meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to \nsmear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black man, one \nof whose arms will resemble a woman's breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.

He said to `Azib. \n\"Tell your son to carry it with me.\" So I carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the \nprice (of the saddle). My father said, \"O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night \njourney with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (during Migration).\" He said, \"Yes, we travelled the whole night and also \nthe next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the severe heat) . Then \nthere appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine had not come to it yet. So we \ndismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet (ﷺ) \nto sleep on (for a while). \nI then said, 'Sleep, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and I will guard you.' So he slept and I went out to guard him. \nSuddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we had when \nwe came to it. I asked (him). 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He replied, 'I belong to a man from \nMedina or Mecca.' I said, 'Do your sheep have milk?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you milk for us?' He \nsaid, 'Yes.' He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The \nsub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara' striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the \nshepherd removed the dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a \nleather container which I carried for the Prophet (ﷺ) to drink and perform the ablution from. I went to the \nProphet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet (ﷺ) had already awakened; so I \npoured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was cold. Then I said, 'Drink, O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He drank till I was pleased. \nThen he asked, 'Has the time for our departure come?' I said, 'Yes.' So we departed after midday. \nSuraqa bin Malik followed us and I said, 'We have been discovered, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He said, Don't \ngrieve for Allah is with us.' The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so the legs of his horse \nsank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not sure whether Abu Bakr said, \"(It \nsank) into solid earth.\") Suraqa said, 'I see that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on \nme, and by Allah, I will cause those who are seeking after you to return.' The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked good \non him and he was saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, 'I have looked \nfor him here in vain.' So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his promise.\"</b>",

As for the one for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse \nfor the sake of Jihad in Allah's Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So \nwhatever its rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if it \nbreaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be considered amongst his \ngood deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it, that will be considered as good deeds \nfor his benefit) even if he has had no intention of watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who \nkeeps it so that he may earn his living honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following \nillegal ways (of gaining money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and \nallowing others to use it for Allah's Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for \nhim who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the Muslims.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about donkeys. He replied, \"Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them \nexcept this comprehensive Verse (which covers everything) :--'Then whosoever has done good equal \nto the weight of an atom (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal \nto the weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).\" (99.7-8)</b>",
