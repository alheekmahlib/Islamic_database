Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group \nof Al-Ash`ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of rak`at. We asked for \nmounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, 'I have nothing to mount \nyou on' In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he asked twice, \n'Where are Al-Ash`ariyin?\" So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short \nwhile (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has \nforgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of his oath, we will never be \nsuccessful.\" So we returned to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We asked you for mounts, \nbut you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your \noath.' He said, 'It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath \nand later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.' \"</b>",
