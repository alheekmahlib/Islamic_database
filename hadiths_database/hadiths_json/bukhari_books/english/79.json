When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that \ngathering, `Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the Prophet), \"Don't \ncover us with dust.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them and then stopped, dismounted and invited them to \nAllah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the Holy Qur'an. `Abdullah bin Ubai' bin Salul \nsaid, \"O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble \nus in our gatherings. Go back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your \ntales) to him.\" On that `Abdullah bin Rawaha said, \"(O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!) Come to us and bring it(what \nyou want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.\" So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started \nquarreling till they were about to fight and clash with one another. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on quietening \nthem (till they all became quiet). He then rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa`d bin \n'Ubada, he said, \"O Sa`d, didn't you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant `Abdullah bin Ubai). He \nsaid so-and-so.\" Sa`d bin 'Ubada said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Excuse and forgive him, for by Allah, \nAllah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided to crown him (as their \nchief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with the Truth which He had given \nyou, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the way you saw him behaving.\" So the \nProphet excused him.</b>",
