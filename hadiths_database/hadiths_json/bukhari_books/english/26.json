(the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not \nharmful if those who perform Hajj or `Umra of the House (Ka`ba at Mecca) to perform the going \n(Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not \nperform the Tawaf between them.\" `Aisha replied, \"No, for if it were as you are saying, then the \nrecitation would have been like this: 'It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.' This verse \nwas revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which \nwas put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As- \nSafa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that, and Allah revealed:-- \n\"Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not \nharmful of those who perform Hajj or `Umra of the House (Ka`ba at Mecca) to perform the going \n(Tawaf) between them.\" (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from `Aisha): \"The \nHajj or `Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa \nis incomplete in Allah's sight.</b>",
