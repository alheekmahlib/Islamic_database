        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\n\n<p>By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the \nground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my \nbelly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) \nused to come out. When Abu Bakr passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Allah's Book and I \nasked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then `Umar \npassed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Allah's Book, and I asked him only that he might \nsatisfy my hunger, but he passed by without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) passed by \nme and he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, \"O \nAba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!\" I replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said to me, \"Follow me.\" He left \nand I followed him. \nThen he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl \nand said, \"From where is this milk?\" They said, \"It has been presented to you by such-and-such man \n(or by such and such woman).\" He said, \"O Aba Hirr!\" I said, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \n\"Go and call the people of Suffa to me.\" These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no \nfamilies, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of charity was brought to \nthe Prophet, he would send it to them and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present \nwas given to him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order of the \nProphet upset me, and I said to myself, \"How will this little milk be enough for the people of As- \nSuffa? though I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself\", but behold! \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for \nme, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and \ncalled them, and they came and asked the Prophet's permission to enter. They were admitted and took \ntheir seats in the house. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Aba-Hirr!\" I said, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"Take it and give it to \nthem.\" So I took the bowl (of milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and \nreturn it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and \nreturn it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. \nFinally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who took the bowl and put it \non his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. \"O Aba Hirr!\" I replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" \nHe said, \"There remain you and I.\" I said, \"You have said the truth, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"Sit \ndown and drink.\" I sat down and drank. He said, \"Drink,\" and I drank. He kept on telling me \nrepeatedly to drink, till I said, \"No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in \nmy stomach).\" He said, \"Hand it over to me.\" When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and \npronounced Allah's Name on it and drank the remaining milk.</b>",

He also told us about its disappearance, saying, \"A man will go to sleep \nwhereupon honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, resembling the \ntraces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away \n(from his heart) and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the surface of skin, when an \nember touches one's foot; and in fact, this blister does not contain anything. So there will come a day \nwhen people will deal in business with each other but there will hardly be any trustworthy persons \namong them. Then it will be said that in such-and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who is \nhonest, and a man will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, though indeed he \nwill not have belief equal to a mustard seed in his heart.\" The narrator added: There came upon me a \ntime when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would \nprevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from \ncheating; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so.

'So, he who used to worship the sun, \nwill follow it, and he who used to worship the moon will follow it, and he who used to worship false \ndeities will follow them; and then only this nation (i.e., Muslims) will remain, including their \nhypocrites. Allah will come to them in a shape other than they know and will say, 'I am your Lord.' \nThey will say, 'We seek refuge with Allah from you. This is our place; (we will not follow you) till \nour Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us, we will recognize Him. \nThen Allah will come to then in a shape they know and will say, \"I am your Lord.' They will say, '(No \ndoubt) You are our Lord,' and they will follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid over the (Hell) Fire.\" \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) added, \"I will be the first to cross it. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day, \nwill be 'Allahumma Sallim, Sallim (O Allah, save us, save us!),' and over that bridge there will be \nhooks Similar to the thorns of As Sa'dan (a thorny tree). Didn't you see the thorns of As-Sa'dan?\" The \ncompanions said, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" He added, \"So the hooks over that bridge will be like the \nthorns of As-Sa-dan except that their greatness in size is only known to Allah. These hooks will snatch \nthe people according to their deeds. Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some \nwill be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved afterwards, when Allah has finished the \njudgments among His slaves, and intends to take out of the Fire whoever He wishes to take out from \namong those who used to testify that none had the right to be worshipped but Allah. \nWe will order the angels to take them out and the angels will know them by the mark of the traces of \nprostration (on their foreheads) for Allah banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the \nbody of Adam's son. So they will take them out, and by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then \nwater, called Ma'ul Hayat (water of life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed \nsprings out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain one man who will be facing the \n(Hell) Fire and will say, 'O Lord! It's (Hell's) vapor has Poisoned and smoked me and its flame has \nburnt me; please turn my face away from the Fire.' He will keep on invoking Allah till Allah says, \n'Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you will ask for another thing?' The man will say, 'No, by Your \nPower, I will not ask You for anything else.' \nThen Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. The man will say after that, 'O Lord, bring me near \nthe gate of Paradise.' Allah will say (to him), 'Didn't you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to \nyou, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' The man will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will \nsay, 'But if I give you that, you may ask me for something else.' The man will say, 'No, by Your \nPower. I will not ask for anything else.' He will give Allah his covenant and promise not to ask for \nanything else after that. So Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise, and when he sees what is \nin it, he will remain silent as long as Allah will, and then he will say, 'O Lord! Let me enter Paradise.' \nAllah will say, 'Didn't you promise that you would not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to \nyou, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' On that, the man will say, 'O Lord! Do not make me \nthe most wretched of Your creation,' and will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will smile and when \nAllah will smile because of him, then He will allow him to enter Paradise, and when he will enter \nParadise, he will be addressed, 'Wish from so-and-so.' He will wish till all his wishes will be fulfilled, \nthen Allah will say, All this (i.e. what you have wished for) and as much again therewith are for you.' \n\" \nAbu Huraira added: That man will be the last of the people of Paradise to enter (Paradise).</b>",
