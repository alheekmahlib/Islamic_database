Um Salama told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what they had said, but he did not \nreply. \nThen they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it.

When they asked her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, \"Talk to him till \nhe gives you a reply.\" When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to her, \"Do not hurt \nme regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of \nAisha.\" On that Um Salama said, \"I repent to Allah for hurting you.\" Then the group of Um Salama \ncalled Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and sent her to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to say to him, \"Your \nwives request to treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.\" \nThen Fatima conveyed the message to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O my daughter! Don't you love whom \nI love?\" She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested her \nto go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him and used harsh \nwords saying, \"Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal \nterms.\" On that she raised her voice and abused `Aisha to her face so much so that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nlooked at `Aisha to see whether she would retort. `Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced \nher.
