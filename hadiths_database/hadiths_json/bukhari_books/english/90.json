Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her \nlonger than the period he used to stay, so I enquired about it. It was said to me, \"A woman from her \ntribe gave her a leather skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nto drink.\" I said, \"By Allah, we will play a trick on him.\" So I mentioned the story to Sauda (the wife \nof the Prophet) and said to her, \"When he enters upon you, he will come near to you whereupon you \nshould say to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He will say, 'No.' Then you say to \nhim, 'What is this bad smell? ' And it would be very hard on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that a bad smell should be \nfound on his body. He will say, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' Then you should say to him, \n'Its bees must have sucked from the Al-`Urfut (a foul smelling flower).' I too, will tell him the same. \nAnd you, O Saifya, say the same.\" \nSo when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon Sauda (the following happened). Sauda said, \"By Him except \nWhom none has the right to be worshipped, I was about to say to him what you had told me to say \nwhile he was still at the gate because of fear from you. But when Allah 's Apostle came near to me, I \nsaid to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He replied, 'No.' I said, 'What about this \nsmell?' He said, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' I said, 'Its bees must have sucked Al-`Urfut.' \" \nWhen he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he entered upon Safiya, she too told \nhim the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said to him, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you a \ndrink of it (honey)?\" He said, \"I have no desire for it.\" Sauda said, Subhan Allah! We have deprived \nhim of it (honey).\" I said to her, \"Be quiet!\"</b>",
