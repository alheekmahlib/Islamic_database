'You are a wise young man and we do not have any \nsuspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So you should \nsearch for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur'an and collect it in one book.\" By Allah If they had \nordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me \nto collect the Qur'an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, \"How will you do something which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did \nnot do?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"By Allah, it is a good project.\" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his \nidea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and `Umar. So I \nstarted looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from (what was written on) palme stalks, thin white \nstones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat at-Tauba \n(Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The \nVerse is: \n'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him \nthat you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (at-Tauba) (9.128-129). \nThen the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur'an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with \n`Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of `Umar.</b>",
