I \nlooked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a \nlittle shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet (ﷺ) in the shade and said to him, \n'Lie down, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' So the Prophet (ﷺ) lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there \nwas any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking \nwhat we had already sought from it. I asked him, 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He said, 'I belong \nto a man from Quraish.' He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, 'Is there any milk with \nyour sheep?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you then milk (some) for us?' He said, 'Yes.' Then I asked him \nto tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from \ndust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, \nhe milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a leather water-container, the \nmouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower \npart was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet (ﷺ) whom I found awake. I said to him, 'Drink, O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ).' So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, 'It is time for us to move, O Allah's \nApostle!' He said, 'Yes.' So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, \nbut none found us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum who was riding his horse. I said, 'These are \nour pursuers who have found us. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He said, 'Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.\"</b>",

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is not dead!\" 'Umar (later on) said, \"By Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind except that.\" He said, \"Verily! Allah will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.\" Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), kissed him and said, \"Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice.\" Then he went out and said, \"O oath-taker! Don't be hasty.\" When Abu Bakr spoke, 'Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.\" Then he recited Allah's Statement.:-- \"(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.\" (39.30) He also recited:-- <p> \"Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.\" (3.144) <p> The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin 'Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). \"There should be one 'Amir from us and one from you.\" Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu 'baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. 'Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. 'Umar later on used to say, \"By Allah, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, \"We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),\" Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, \"No, by Allah we won't accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.\" Abu Bakr said, \"No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the 'Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either 'Umar or Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.\" 'Umar said (to Abu Bakr), \"No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" So 'Umar took Abu Bakr's hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, \"You have killed Sad bin Ubada.\" 'Umar said, \"Allah has killed him.\"</b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nNarrated `Amr bin Maimun:\n\n<p>I saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with \nHudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and `Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, \"What have you done? Do you \nthink that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. 'Iraq) than it can bear?\" They \nreplied, \"We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.\" `Umar again said, \"Check \nwhether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.\" They said, \"No, (we haven't).\" `Umar \nadded, \"If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after \nme.\" But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was \nstanding and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. `Umar) except `Abdullah bin `Abbas. \nWhenever `Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, \"Stand in straight lines.\" \nWhen he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would \nrecite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak`a so that the people may have the time to Join \nthe prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, \"The dog has killed or eaten me,\" at the \ntime he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged \nknife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons \nout of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that \nhe had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, `Umar held the hand of `Abdur-Rahman bin \n`Auf and let him lead the prayer. \nThose who were standing by the side of `Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other \nparts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of `Umar and they were saying, \n\"Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).\" `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf led the people a \nshort prayer. When they finished the prayer, `Umar said, \"O Ibn `Abbas! Find out who attacked me.\" \nIbn `Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. \"The slave of Al \nMughira.\" On that `Umar said, \"The craftsman?\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Yes.\" `Umar said, \"May Allah \ncurse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at \nthe hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to \nlove to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.\" Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn \n`Abbas said to `Umar. \"If you wish, we will do.\" He meant, \"If you wish we will kill them.\" `Umar \nsaid, \"You are mistaken (for you can't kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed \ntowards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.\" \nThen `Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had \nnever suffered a calamity before. Some said, \"Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).\" Some said, \n\"We are afraid (that he will die).\" Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it \ncame out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came \nout of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising \nhim. A young man came saying, \"O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you \ndue to your company with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you \nbecame the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.\" `Umar \nsaid, \"I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose \nnor gain anything.\" \nWhen the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. `Umar said, \n\"Call the young man back to me.\" (When he came back) `Umar said, \"O son of my brother! Lift your \nclothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.\" `Umar \nfurther said, \"O `Abdullah bin `Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.\" When the debt was \nchecked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. `Umar said, \"If the property of `Umar's \nfamily covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, and if \nthat too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay \nthis debt on my behalf.\" \n`Umar then said (to `Abdullah), \"Go to `Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: \"`Umar is paying \nhis salutation to you. But don't say: 'The chief of the believers,' because today I am not the chief of the \nbelievers. And say: \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions \n(i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).\" `Abdullah greeted `Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, \nand then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab is \npaying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.\" She \nsaid, \"I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer `Umar to myself.\" When he \nreturned it was said (to `Umar), \"`Abdullah bin `Umar has come.\" `Umar said, \"Make me sit up.\" \nSomebody supported him against his body and `Umar asked (`Abdullah), \"What news do you have?\" \nHe said, \"O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.\" `Umar said, \n\"Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and \ngreet `Aisha and say: \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet (ﷺ) ), and \nif she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the \nMuslims.\" \nThen Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we \nsaw her, we went away. She went in (to `Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for \npermission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to \n`Umar), \"O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.\" `Umar said, \"I do not find anyone more \nsuitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been pleased with \nbefore he died.\" Then `Umar mentioned `Ali, `Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sa`d and `Abdur-Rahman \n(bin `Auf) and said, \"Abdullah bin `Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the \nrule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sa`d becomes the \nruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not \ndismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.\" `Umar added, \"I recommend that my successor \ntakes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. \nI also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and \nBelief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the \nrighteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all \nthe people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and \nthe source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from \ntheir surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the 'Arab bedouin, as they are \nthe origin of the 'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their \nproperties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah's and \nHis Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to \noverburden them with what is beyond their ability.\" So when `Umar expired, we carried him out and \nset out walking. `Abdullah bin `Umar greeted (`Aisha) and said, \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the \npermission.\" `Aisha said, \"Bring him in.\" He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. \nWhen he was buried, the group (recommended by `Umar) held a meeting. Then `Abdur-Rahman said, \n\" Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.\" Az-Zubair said, \"I give up my right to `Ali.\" \nTalha said, \"I give up my right to `Uthman,\" Sa`d, 'I give up my right to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf.\" \n`Abdur-Rahman then said (to `Uthman and `Ali), \"Now which of you is willing to give up his right of \ncandidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and \nIslam will be his witnesses.\" So both the sheiks (i.e. `Uthman and `Ali) kept silent. `Abdur-Rahman \nsaid, \"Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but \nthe better of you?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So `Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. `Ali) and \nsaid, \"You are related to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask \nyou by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select `Uthman as a \nruler you will listen to him and obey him.\" Then he took the other (i.e. `Uthman) aside and said the \nsame to him. When `Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, \"O `Uthman! \nRaise your hand.\" So he (i.e. `Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. `Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then \n`Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of \nallegiance.</b>",

She asked for the \n     Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet (ﷺ) \n     at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., \n     one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,\n     'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave \n     is Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. \n     Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the food \n     they need.' By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the \n     Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed\n     in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as \n     Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do,\" Then 'Ali said, \"I testify that None has \n     the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His \n     Apostle,\" and added, \"O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.\" \n     Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah's \n     Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, \"By Allah in \n     Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah's \n     Apostle rather than to my own relatives\"<p></b>",
