How excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected \nthrough legal means and is spent in Allah's Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he \nwho does not take it legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness \nagainst him on the Day of Resurrection.\"</b>",

Caesar as a sign of gratitude to Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when \nAllah had granted Him victory over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached \nCaesar, he said after reading it, 'Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present \nhere, in order to ask him about Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with \nsome men from Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that had been \nconcluded between Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); and the infidels of Quraish. \nAbu Sufyan said, Caesar's messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my \ncompanions to Ilya and we were admitted into Ceasar's court to find him sitting in his royal court \nwearing a crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his translator. \n'Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a prophet.\" Abu Sufyan \nadded, \"I replied, 'I am the nearest relative to him.' He asked, 'What degree of relationship do you have \nwith him?' I replied, 'He is my cousin,' and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except \nmyself. Caesar said, 'Let him come nearer.' He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near \nmy shoulder and said to his translator, 'Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the \nman who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.\" Abu \nSufyan added, \"By Allah! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a liar, I would not \nhave spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by \nmy companions. So I told the truth. \nHe then said to his translator, 'Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.' I replied, 'He belongs \nto a noble family amongst us.' He said, 'Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before \nhim? 'I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he \nclaimed? ' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?' I replied, 'No.' He \nsaid, \"Do the noble or the poor follow him?' I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.' He said, 'Are \nthey increasing or decreasing (day by day)?' I replied,' They are increasing.' He said, 'Does anybody \namongst those who embrace his (the Prophet's) Religion become displeased and then discard his \nReligion?'. I replied, 'No. ' He said, 'Does he break his promises? I replied, 'No, but we are now at \ntruce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"Other than the last \nsentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, 'Have you ever had a war with \nhim?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'What was the outcome of your battles with him?' I replied, 'The result \nwas unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.' He said, 'What does he order you to \ndo?' I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave \nall that our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep \npromises and return what is entrusted to us.' \nWhen I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, 'Say to him: I ask you about his lineage and your \nreply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of \ntheir nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and \nyour reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \nthis man was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever \nblamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did \nnot tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether any \nof his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I \nwould have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you \nwhether the rich or the poor people followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. \nIn fact, such are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing \nor decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is \ncomplete (in all respects). \nI asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and \ndiscarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its \ncheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you \nwhether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they \nnever break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, \nyou replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the \napostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. \nThen I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and \nnot to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to offer \nprayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. \nThese are really the qualities of a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, \nbut I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very \nsoon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go \nimmediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.' \" Abu Sufyan \nadded, \"Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and it was read. Its contents were: \n\"In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the \nslave of Allah, and His Apostle, to Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the \nfollowers of guidance. Now then, I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and \nyou will be safe; embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this \ninvitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the tillers (i.e. your nation). O people of \nthe Scriptures!

So, I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Sell it to me then.\" I sold it to \nhim on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I reached Medina. Then I said, \"O Allah's \nApostle! I am a bridegroom,\" and requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out \nfor Medina before the people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the \ncamel and I informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had \nmarried a matron. He said, \"Why hadn't you married a virgin who would have played with you, and \nyou would have played with her?\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My father died (or was martyred) and \nI have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that I should marry a young girl like them who would \nneither teach them manners nor serve them. So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them \nand teach them manners.\" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next \nmorning and he gave me its price and gave me the camel itself as well.</b>",

Do not wish to meet \n     the enemy, and ask Allah for safety, but when you face the enemy, be \n     patient, and remember that Paradise is under the shades of swords.\" \n     Then he said, \"O Allah, the Revealer of the Holy Book, and the Mover \n     of the clouds and the Defeater of the clans, defeat them, and grant us\n     victory over them.\"\n<p></b>",

By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles \nand their legs. So, the companions of `Abdullah bin Jubair said, \"The booty! O people, the booty ! \nYour companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?\" `Abdullah bin Jubair said, \n\"Have you forgotten what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to you?\" They replied, \"By Allah! We will go to the \npeople (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.\" But when they went to them, they \nwere forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in their rear was calling them back. \nOnly twelve men remained with the Prophet (ﷺ) and the infidels martyred seventy men from us. \nOn the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions had caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 \nmen, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, \"Is \nMuhammad present amongst these people?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his companions not to answer him. \nThen he asked thrice, \"Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?\" He asked again \nthrice, \"Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?\" He then returned to his companions \nand said, \"As for these (men), they have been killed.\" `Umar could not control himself and said (to \nAbu Sufyan), \"You told a lie, by Allah!

By Allah! I will not go with you. No \ndoubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.\" So, they dragged him and tried to \ncompel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn \nDathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. \nKhubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Naufal bin `Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib \nwho had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a \nprisoner with those people. \nNarrated Az-Zuhri: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Iyyad said that the daughter of Al-Harith had told him, \"When \nthose people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it \nto him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing \nmy son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the \nagitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Allah, I \nnever saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in \nhis hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca.\" The daughter of \nAl-Harith used to say, \"It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.\" When they took him out of the \nSanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two \nrak`at (prayer). \nThey allowed him and he offered Two rak`at and then said, \"Hadn't I been afraid that you would think \nthat I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no \nexception.\" (He then recited the poetic verse):-- \"I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am \nkilled in Allah's Cause, For my killing is for Allah's Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the \namputated parts of a torn body\" Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the \ntradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-rak`at prayer (before being \nkilled). Allah fulfilled the invocation of `Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when \nsome infidels from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch \na part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) `Asim had \nkilled one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady \ncloud, were sent to hover over `Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not \ncut off anything from his flesh.</b>",
