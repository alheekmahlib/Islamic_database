A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and \nblocked it. They said to each other. 'Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah's \nsake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from \nyour difficulty. one of them said, 'O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small \nchildren for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked \n(the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one \nday I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn't return home till late at \nnight and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk \nvessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to \ngive the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my \nfeet. \nSo this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had \ndone that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can \nsee the sky.' So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the \nsecond person said, 'O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a \nwoman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I \ncollected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have \nsexual intercourse with her), she said, 'O Allah's slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me \nexcept legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only \nfor seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.' \nSo Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said 'O \nAllah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had \nfinished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and \nrefused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the \nprice of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. '(O Allah's \nslave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.' I said (to him). 'Go and take \nthose cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that \nI had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.' And so \nAllah released them (from their difficulty).</b>",

For what are you making fires?\" They said, \"For cooking meat.\" He asked, \"What kind of \nmeat?\" They said, \"Donkeys' meat.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Throw away the meat and break the \ncooking pots.\" A man said, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking \npots?\" He said, \"You can do that too.\" When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), 'Amir's \nsword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the \nsword turned back and hit 'Amir's knee and caused him to die. \nWhen the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw me pale and said, \n'What is wrong with you?\"' I said, \"Let my parents be sacrificed for you!

Ibn Saiyad \nwas nearing his puberty at that time, and he did not notice the arrival of the Prophet (ﷺ) till Allah's \nApostle stroked him on the back with his hand and said, \"Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" \nIbn Saiyad looked at him and said, \"I testify that you are the Apostle of the unlettered ones \n(illiterates)\". Then Ibn Saiyad said to the Prophets . \"Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" The \nProphet denied that, saying, \"I believe in Allah and all His Apostles,\" and then said to Ibn Saiyad, \n\"What do you see?\" Ibn Saiyad said, \"True people and liars visit me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You have \nbeen confused as to this matter.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) added, \"I have kept something for you (in my \nmind).\" Ibn Saiyad said, \"Ad-Dukh.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Ikhsa (you should be ashamed) for you can \nnot cross your limits.\" `Umar said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop off h is neck.\" Allah's \nApostle said (to `Umar). \"Should this person be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot over-power him; \nand should he be someone else, then it will be no use your killing him.\" `Abdullah bin `Umar added: \nLater on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Ubai bin Ka`b Al-Ansari (once again) went to the garden in which Ibn \nSaiyad was present. \nWhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered the garden, he started hiding behind the trunks of the date-palms \nintending to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was Lying on \nhis bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his mumur were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the \nProphet and said, \"O Saf (the nickname of Ibn Saiyad)! Here is Muhammad!\" Ibn Saiyad stopped his \nmurmuring. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If his mother had kept quiet, then I would have learnt more about \nhim.\" `Abdullah added: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up before the people (delivering a sermon), and after \npraising and glorifying Allah as He deserved, he mentioned the Ad-Dajjal saying, \"I warn you against \nhim, and there has been no prophet but warned his followers against him. Noah warned his followers \nagainst him but I am telling you about him, something which no prophet has told his people of, and \nthat is: Know that he is blind in one eye where as Allah is not so.\"</b>",

He was visiting Sa`d bin 'Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith \nbin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed \nby a gathering in which `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before `Abdullah bin \nUbat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the \nMuslims there was `Abdullah bin Rawaha. \nWhen a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, `Abdullah bin \nUbai covered his nose with his garment and said, \"Do not cover us with dust.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) greeted \nthem, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the \nHoly Qur'an. On that `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, \"O man! There is nothing better than \nwhat you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to \nyou, you can preach to him.\" On that `Abdullah bin Rawaha said \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Call on us \nin our gathering, for we love that.\" So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one \nanother till they were about to fight with one another. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till all \nof them became quiet, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon \nSa`d bin 'Ubada. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"O Sa`d! Didn't you hear what Abu Habab said?\" (meaning \n`Abdullah bin Unbar). \"He said so-and-so.\" Sa`d bin Ubada said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Let my father be \nsacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the \nTruth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him \n(`Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler. \nSo when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that \ncaused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) excused \nhim. (It was the custom of) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of \nthe scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed \n(by them). Allah said: 'You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the \nScripture before you.....and from the pagans (3.186) \nHe also said: 'Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers \nafter you have believed. .... (2.109) So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to apply what Allah had ordered him by \nexcusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had fought the battle of \nBadr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, \nand Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them \nsome of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. `Abdullah bin Ubai bin \nSalul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, \"This matter (Islam) has now brought out its \nface (triumphed), so give Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)\".
