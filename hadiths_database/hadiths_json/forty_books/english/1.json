Inform me about Islam.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: \"Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger (ﷺ), that you should perform salah (ritual prayer), pay the zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (the Ka`bah at Makkah), if you can find a way to it (or find the means for making the journey to it).\" He said: \"You have spoken the truth.\"\n\nWe were astonished at his thus questioning him (ﷺ) and then telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, \"Inform me about Iman (faith).\" He (the Prophet) answered, \"It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in fate (qadar), both in its good and in its evil aspects.\" He said, \"You have spoken the truth.\"\n\nThen he (the man) said, \"Inform me about Ihsan.\" He (the Prophet) answered, \"It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet He sees you.\"\n\nHe said, \"Inform me about the Hour.\" He (the Prophet) said, \"About that the one questioned knows no more than the questioner.\" So he said, \"Well, inform me about its signs.\" He said, \"They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and that you will see the barefooted ones, the naked, the destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings.\" Thereupon the man went off.\n\nI waited a while, and then he (the Prophet) said, \"O `Umar, do you know who that questioner was?\" I replied, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" He said, \"That was Jibril.

Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, then ask Allah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah [alone]. And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allah had already prescribed against you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.”\n\nIt was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a good and sound hadeeth. Another narration, other than that of Tirmidhi, reads:\n\nBe mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. Recognize and acknowledge Allah in times of ease and prosperity, and He will remember you in times of adversity. And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by.
