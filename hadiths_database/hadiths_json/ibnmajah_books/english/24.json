Fight but do\nnot\nbe treacherous, do not steal from the spoils of war, do not\nmutilate\nand do not kill children. When you meet your enemy from\namong the\npolytheists, call them to one of three things. Whichever of\nthem they\nrespond to, accept it from them and refrain from fighting\nthem. Invite\nthem to accept Islam, and if they respond then accept it\nfrom them and\nrefrain from fighting them. Then invite them to leave\ntheir land and\nmove to the land of the polytheists. Tell them that if\nthey do that,\nthen they will have the same rights and duties as the\npolytheists. If\nthey refuse, then tell them that they will be like\nthe Muslim Bedouins\n(who live in the desert), subject to the same\nrulings of Allah as the\nbelievers. But they will have no share of\nFay’* or war spoils, unless\nthey fight alongside the Muslims. If\nthey refuse to enter Islam, then\nask them to pay the Poll-tax. If\nthey do that, then accept it from\nthem and refrain from fighting\nthem. But if they refuse, then seek the\nhelp of Allah against them\nand fight them. If you lay siege to them\nand they want you to give\nthem the protection of Allah and your\nProphet, do not give them the\nprotection of Allah and your Prophet,\nrather give them your\nprotection and the protection of your father and\nyour Companions, for\nif you violate your protection and the protection\nof your fathers,\nthat is easier than violating the protection of Allah\nand the\nprotection of His Messenger.
