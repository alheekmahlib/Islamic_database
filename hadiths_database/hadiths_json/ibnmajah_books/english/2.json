When the sun passed its zenith he commanded Bilal to call the Adhan, then he commanded him to give the Iqamah for Zuhr; then he commanded him to give the Iqamah for 'Asr when the sun was high and clearly white. Then he commanded him to give the Iqamah for Maghrib when the sun had set; then he commanded him to give the Iqamah for 'Isha' when the red afterglow had disappeared; then he commanded him to give the Iqamah for Fajr when dawn came. On the following day he commanded him to give the Adhan for Zuhr when the extreme heat had passed and it had cooled down; then he prayed 'Asr when the sun was still high, but he delayed it more than he had done the day before; then he prayed Maghrib before the red afterglow disappeared; he prayed 'Isha' when one-third of the night had passed; and he prayed Fajr at the time when it was already light. Then he said: 'Where is the one who was asking about the times of Prayer?' The man said: 'Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'The times of your prayer are between the times you have seen.'\"</b>",

When dawn was approaching, Bilal went to his mount, facing towards the east, watching for the dawn. Then Bilal's eyes grew heavy while he was leaning on his mount (and he slept). Neither Bilal nor any of his Companions woke until they felt the heat of the sun. The Messenger of Allah was the first one to wake up. The Messenger of Allah was startled and said: \"O Bilal!\" Bilal said: \"The same thing happened to me as happened to you. May my father and mother be ransomed for you, O Messenger of Allah!\" He said: \"Bring your mounts forward a little.\" So they brought their mounts forward a little (away from that place). Then the Messenger of Allah performed ablution and told Bilal to call the Iqamah for prayer, and he led them in the prayer. When the Prophet finished praying, he said: \"Whoever forgets a Salah, let him pray it when he remembers, for Allah says: And perform the prayer for My remembrance.\" [Ta-Ha: 14] He (one of the narrators) said: \"Ibn Shihab used to recite this Verse as meaning, 'when you remember'.\"</b>",
