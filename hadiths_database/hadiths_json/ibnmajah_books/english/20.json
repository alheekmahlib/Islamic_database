We said: “Come, let us agree upon something that we may impose on both noble and weak alike.” So we agreed to blacken the face and whip them, instead of stoning.'

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'I will not give you permission, or honor you nor give you, what you want. You are lying, O enemy of Allah. Allah (SWT) has granted you a good, lawful provision, but you have chosen the provision that Allah (SWT) has forbidden to you instead of that which He has permitted. If I had warned you before, I would have done such and such to you. Get away from me and repent to Allah (SWT). If you do that again, after this warning, I will give you a painful beating and shave your head, to make an example of you, and I will banish you from among your people, and tell the young men of Al-Madinah to come and take your goods,'Amr stood up, suffering grief and humiliation that is known only to Allah (SWT).\nWhen he went away, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Those sinners, whoever among them dies without having repented, Allah (SWT) will gather him on the Day of Resurrection just as he was in this world, effeminate and naked, with not even a piece of cloth to conceal him from the people. Every time he gets up, he will fall to the ground.'”</b>",
