I heard it and memorized it: 'A man killed ninety-nine people, then the idea of repentance occurred to him. He asked who was the most knowledgeable of people on earth, and he was told of a man so he went to him and said: “I have killed ninety-nine people. Can I repent?” He said: “After ninety-nine people?!” He said: 'So he drew his sword and killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then the idea of repentance occurred to him (again), so he asked who was the most knowledgeable of people, and he was told of a man (so he went to him) and said: “I have killed one hundred people. Can I repent?” He said: “Woe to you, what is stopping you from repenting? Leave the evil town where you are living and go to a good town, such and such town and worship your Lord there.” So he went out, heading for the good town, but death came to him on the road. The angels of mercy and angels of punishment argued over him. Iblis (Satan) said: “I have more right to him, for he never disobeyed me for a moment.” But the angels of mercy said: “He went out repenting.” (One of the narrators) Hammam said: “Humaid At-Tawil narrated to me from Bakr bin Abdullah that Abu Rafi said: 'So Allah (SWT) sent an angel to whom they referred (the case). He said: “Look and see which of the two towns was he closer, and put him with its people.”\n(One of the narrators) Qatadah said: “Hasan narrated to us: 'When death came to him he strove and drew closer to the good town, and farther away from the evil town, so they put him with the people of the good town.”</b>",

Then he and his brother Huwayyisah, who was older than him, and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, came (to the Prophet (ﷺ)). Muhayyisah, who was the one who had been at Khaibar, went and he began to speak, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Let the elder speak first.” So Huwayyisah spoke, then Muhayyisah spoke. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Either (the Jews) will pay the blood money for your companion, or war will be declared on them.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a letter to that effect (to the Jews) and they wrote back saying: “By Allah, we did not kill him.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Huwayyisah, Muhayyisah and Abdur-Rahman: “Will you swear an oath establishing your claim to the blood money of your companion?” They said: “No” He said: “Should the Jews swear an oath for you?” They said: “They are not Muslims.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid the blood money himself, and he sent one hundred she-camels to them and some of them entered the house.
