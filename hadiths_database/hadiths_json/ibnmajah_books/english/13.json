He asked two of them: “Do you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?” And they said: “No.” He asked another two of them: “Do you affirm that this child belongs to (the third man)?” And they said: “No.” Every time he asked two of them whether they affirmed that the child belonged to the third, they would say no. So he cast lots between them, and attributed the child to the one whose name was chosen in this manner, and obliged him to pay two thirds of the Diyah. The Prophet (ﷺ) was told of this, and he smiled so broadly that his back teeth became visible.</b>",
