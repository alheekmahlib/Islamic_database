Then he will go to sleep\nagain and the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away (from\nhis heart) and leaving a trace like a blister, as when an ember\ntouches your foot and raises a blister which has nothing inside.’”\nThen Hudhaifah picked up a handful of pebbles and rolled them on his\nleg. He said: “People will engage in business with one another, but\nthere will hardly be any honest persons among them. Then it will be\nsaid that in such and such a tribe there is an honest man, and a man\nwill be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, but\nthere will not be even a mustard seed of faith in his heart.”\n\"There was a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from cheating.

The people were\nalarmed by\nthat, and some were standing and some were sitting. He\ngestured to\nthem with his hand, telling them to sit. (Then he said:)\n'By Allah, I\nam not standing here for something that will benefit\nyou, an\nexhortation or warning. Rather Tamim Dari has come to me and\ntold me\nsomething that prevented me from taking a rest because of the\njoy and\ndelight (I felt), and I wanted to spread that joy among you.\nA cousin\nof Tamim Dari told me that the wind drove them to an island\nthat they\ndid not know, so they sat in the rowing boats of the ship\nand set out.\nThere they saw something black, with long eyelashes.\nThey said to it:\n\"What are you?\" It said: \"I am\nJassasah,\" They said: \"Tell us.\" It\nsaid: \"I will\nnot tell you anything or ask you anything. Rather there\nis this\nmonastery that you have looked at. Go to it, for there is a\nman there\nwho is longing to hear your news and tell you news.\" So they\nwent there and entered upon him, and they saw an old man firmly\nshackled, with a sorrowful appearance and complaining a great deal.\nHe\nsaid to them: \"Where have you come from?\" They said:\n\"From Sham.\" He\nsaid: \"How are the Arabs faring?\"\nThey said: \"We are from among the\nArabs. What do you want to ask\nabout?\" He said: \"What has this man\ndone who has appeared\namong you?\" They said: \"(He has done) well. He\nmade enemies\nof some people, but Allah supported him against them and\nnow they\nhave become one, with one God and one religion.\" He said:\n\"What\nhappened to the spring of Zughar?\" They said: \"It is good;\nwe\nirrigate out crops from it and drink from it.\" He said: \"What\nhappened\nto the date-palms between 'Amman and Baisan?\" They\nsaid: \"They bear\nfruit every year.\" He said: \"What\nhappened to the Lake of Tiberias?\"\nThey said: \"It overflows\nbecause of the abundance of water.\" He gave\nthree deep sighs,\nthen he said: \"If I were to free myself from these\nchains, I\nwould not leave any land without entering it on these two\nfeet of\nmine, except for Taibah, for I have no way to enter it.\" The\nProphet (ﷺ) said: 'My joy is so great. This (Al-Madinah) is Taibah,\nand by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no narrow or broad\nroad in it, or any plain or mountain, but there is an angel\n(standing)\nover it with his sword unsheathed, until the Day of\nResurrection.'\"</b>",

        "hadithText": "Nawwas bin Sam'an Al-Kilabi said: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)\nmentioned Dajjal, one morning, as something despised but also\nalarming, until we thought that he was in the stand of date-palm\ntrees. When we came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the evening,\nhe\nsaw that (fear) in us, and said: 'What is the matter with you?' We\nsaid: 'O Messenger of Allah, you mentioned Dajjal this morning, and\nyou spoke of him as something despised but also alarming, until we\nthought that he was in the stand of date-palm trees.' He said:\n'There\nare things that I fear more for you than the Dajjal. If he\nappears\nwhile I am among you, I will contend with him on your behalf,\nand if\nhe appears when I am not among you, then each man must fend for\nhimself, and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He\n(Dajjal) will be a young man with curly hair and a protuberant eye; I\nliken him to 'Abdul-'Uzza bin Qatan. Whoever among you sees him, let\nhim recite the first Verses of Surat Al-Kahf over him. He will emerge\nfrom Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and\nleft. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.' We said: 'O Messenger of\nAllah, how long will he stay on earth?' He said: 'Forty days, one\nday\nlike a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the\nrest\nof his days like your days.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, on\nthat\nday which is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice\nus?' He\nsaid: 'Make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer).'\nWe said:\n'How fast will he move through the earth?' He said: 'Like\na rain\ncloud driving by the wind.' He said: 'He will come to some\npeople and\ncall them, and they will respond and believe in him. Then\nhe will\ncommand the sky to rain and it will rain, and he will command\nthe\nearth to produce vegetation and it will do so, and their flocks\nwill\ncome back in the evening with their humps taller, their udders\nfuller\nand their flanks fatter than they have ever been. Then he will\ncome\nto some (other) people and call them, and they will reject him,\nso he\nwill turn away from them and they will suffer drought and be\nleft\nwith nothing. Then he will pass through the wasteland and will\nsay:\n\"Bring forth your treasures,\" then go away, and its\ntreasures\nwill follow him like a swarm of bees. Then he will call a\nman brimming\nwith youth and will strike him with a sword and cut him\nin two. He\nwill put the two pieces as far apart as the distance\nbetween an archer\nand his target. Then he will call him and he will\ncome with his face\nshining, laughing. While they are like that, Allah\nwill send 'Eisa\nbin Maryam, who will come down at the white minaret\nin the east of\nDamascus, wearing two Mahrud[garment dyed with Wars\nand then Saffron],\nresting his hands on the wings of two angels. When\nhe lowers his head,\nbeads of perspiration will fall from it. Every\ndisbeliever who smells\nthe fragrance of his breath will die, and his\nbreath will reach as far\nas his eye can see. Then he will set out and\ncatch up with him (the\nDajjal) at the gate of Ludd, and will kill\nhim. Then the Prophet of\nAllah 'Eisa will come to some people whom\nAllah has protected, and he\nwill wipe their faces and tell them of\ntheir status in Paradise. While\nthey are like that, Allah will reveal\nto him: \"O 'Eisa, I have\nbrought forth some of My slaves whom no\none will be able to kill, so\ntake My slaves to Tur in safety.\"\nThen Gog and Magog will emerge and\nthey will, as Allah describes,\n\"swoop down from every mound.\"[21:96]\nThe first of them\nwill pass by lake Tiberias and drink from it, then\nthe last of them\nwill pass by it and will say: \"There was water here\nonce.\"\nThe Prophet of Allah, 'Eisa and his companions will be\nbesieged there\nuntil the head of an ox would be dearer to any one of\nthem than one\nhundred Dinar are to any one of you today. Then, the\nProphet of\nAllah, 'Eisa and his companions will supplicate Allah.\nThen Allah\nwill send a worm in their necks and the next morning they\nwill all\ndie as one. The Prophet of Allah 'Eisa and his companions\nwill come\ndown and they will not find even the space of a hand span\nthat is\nfree of their stink, stench and blood. They will pray to\nAllah, and\nHe will send birds with necks like the necks of Bactrian\ncamels,\nwhich will pick them up and throw them wherever Allah wills.\nThen\nAllah will send rain which will not leave any house of clay or\nhair,\nand it will wash the earth until it leaves it like a mirror (or\na\nsmooth rock). Then it will be said to the earth: \"Bring forth\nyour\nfruits and bring back your blessing.\" On that day a group\nof people\nwill eat from a (single) pomegranate and it will suffice\nthem, and\nthey will seek shelter beneath its skin. Allah will bless a\nmilch-\ncamel so that it will be sufficient for a large number of\npeople, and\na milch-cow will be sufficient for a whole tribe and a\nmilch-ewe will\nbe sufficient for a whole clan. While they are like\nthat, Allah will\nsend a pleasant wind which will seize them beneath\ntheir armpits and\nwill take the soul of every Muslim, leaving the\nrest of the people\nfornicating like donkeys, and upon them will come\nthe Hour.'\"</b>",

        "hadithText": "It was narrated that Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said: \"The Messenger\nof Allah (ﷺ) addressed us, and most of his speech had to do with\ntelling us about Dajjal. He warned about him, and among the things he\nsaid was: 'There will not be any tribulation on earth, since the time\nAllah created the offspring of Adam, that will be greater than the\ntribulation of Dajjal. Allah has not sent any Prophet but he warned\nhis nation about Dajjal. I am the last of the Prophets, and you are\nthe last of the nations. He will undoubtedly appear among you. If he\nappears while I am among you, I will contend with him on behalf of\nevery Muslim, and if he appears while I am not among you, then each\nman must fend for himself and Allah will take care of every Muslim on\nmy behalf. He will emerge from Al-Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and\nwill wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.\nI will describe him to you in a manner in which none of the Prophets\nhas described him before me. He will start by saying \"I am a\nProphet,\" and there is no Prophet after me. Then a second time\nhe will say: \"I am your Lord.\" But you will not see your\nLord until you die. He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed,\nand written between his eyes is Kafir. Every believer will read it,\nwhether he is literate or illiterate. Part of his Fitnah will be that\nhe will have with him Paradise and Hell, but his Hell will be a\nParadise and his Paradise a Hell. Whoever is tested with his fire\n(hell), let him seek the help of Allah and recite the first Verses of\nAl-Kahf, then it will be cool and safe for him, as the fire was for\nIbrahim. Part of his Fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin:\n\"What do you think, if I resurrect your father and mother for\nyou, will you bear witness that I am your Lord?\" He will say:\n\"Yes.\" Then two devils will appear to him in the form of\nhis father and mother and will say: \"O my son, follow him, for\nhe is your Lord.\" And part of his Fitnah will be that he will\noverpower a single soul and kill him, then he will cut him with a saw\nuntil he falls in two pieces. Then he will say: \"Look at this\nslave of mine; I will resurrect him now, then he will claim that he\nhas a Lord other than me.\" Then Allah will resurrect him and the\nevil one will say to him: \"Who is your Lord?\" and he will\nsay: \"Allah is my Lord, and you are the enemy of Allah, you are\nDajjal. By Allah, I have never had more insight about you than I have\ntoday.\"\n\n(An addition) Abul-Hasan Tanafisi said: \"Muharibi told us: 'Ubaidullah bin al-Walid Al-Wassafi told us, from 'Atiyyah, that Abu Sa'eed said: \"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'That man will be the highest in status in my nation in Paradise'\" - \nHe said: \"Abu Sa'eed said: 'By Allah, we did not think that man would be anyone other than 'Umar bin Khattab, until he passed away. -  \nMuharibi said: \"Then we went back to the narration of Abu Rafi'.\" He said: - 'Part of his Fitnah will be that he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan and they will disbelieve in him, so all their flocks will perish and none will be left. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan who will believe in him, so he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so, until their flocks will come back in the evening of that day, bigger and fatter than they have ever been, with their flanks stretched and their udders full of milk. There will be no part of the earth left that he does not enter and prevail over, except for Makkah and Al-Madinah, for he will not approach them on any of their mountain paths but he will be met by angels with unsheathed swords, until he will stop at the red hill at the end of the marsh. Then Al-Madinah will be shaken with its people three times, and no hypocrite, male or female, will be left, all will come out to him. Thus it will be cleansed of impurity just as the bellows cleanses the iron of dross. And that day will be called the Day of Deliverance.'\n\"Umm Sharik bint Abi 'akar said: 'O Messenger of Allah, where will the Arabs be that day?' He said: 'On that day they will be few, and most of them will be in Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and their leader will be a righteous man. When their leader has stepped forward to lead them in subh prayer, 'Eisa bin Maryam will come down to them. Their leader will step backwards so that 'Eisa can come forward and lead the people in prayer, but 'Eisa will place his hand between his shoulders and say to him: \"Go forward and pray, for the Iqamah was given for you.\" Then their leader will lead them in prayer. When he has finished, 'Eisa (as), will say: \"Open the gate.\" So they will open it and behind it will be Dajjal with seventy thousand Jews, each of them carrying an adorned sword and wearing a greenish cloak. When Dajjal looks at him, he will start to melt as salt melts in water. He will run away, and 'Eisa (as), will say: \"I have only one blow for you, which you will not be able to escape!\" He will catch up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then Allah will defeat the Jews, and there will be nothing left that Allah has created which the Jews will be able to hide behind, except that Allah will cause it to speak - no stone, no tree, no wall, no animal - except for Al-Gharqad (the box-thorn), for it is one of their trees, and will not speak - except that it will say: \"O Muslim slave of Allah, here is a Jews, come and kill him!\"\n\"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'His (Dajjal's) days will number forty years: a year like half a year, a year like a month, a month like a week, and the rest of his days will be like sparks from a fire (i.e., they will pass quickly). One of you will enter the gate of Al-Madinah in the morning and not reach its other gate until evening comes.' It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how should we pray on those short days?' He said: 'Estimate (the times of) the prayer, as you do on these long days, then pray.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Eisa bin Maryam (as), will be a just judge and a just ruler among my nation. He will break the cross, slaughter the pigs, abolish the Jizyah and charity will be left. No one will be appointed to (collect the Zakah of) sheep and camels. Grudges and mutual hatred will disappear and the venom of every venomous creature will be removed, so that a baby boy will but his hand in a snake and it will not harm him, and a baby girl will make a lion run away, and it will not harm her; and the wolf will be among the sheep like their sheepdog. The earth will be filled with peace just as a vessel is filled with water. The people will be united and none will be worshipped except Allah. War will cease and Quraish will no longer be in power. The earth will be like a silver platter, with its vegetation growing as it did at the time of Adam, until a group of people will gather around one bunch of grapes and it will suffice them, and a group will gather around a single pomegranate and it will suffice them. An ox will be sold for such and such amount of money, and a horse will be sold for a few Dirham.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, why will horses be so cheap?' He said: 'They will never be ridden in war again.' It was said to him: 'Why will oxen be so expensive?' He said: 'Because all the land will be tilled. Before Dajjal appears there will be three difficult years in which the people will suffer severe famine. In the first year, Allah will command the sky to withhold one third of its rain and the earth to withhold one third of its produce. In the second year, He will command the sky to withhold two thirds of its rain and the earth to withhold two-thirds of its produce. In the third year, he will command the sky to withhold all of its rain, and not a single drop will fall, and the earth to withhold all of its produce, and nothing will grow. All cloven-hoofed animals will die, except those that Allah wills.' It was said: 'What will the people live on at that time?' He said: 'Tahlil, Takbir, Tasbih and Tahmid. That will take the place of food for them.'\"\nAbu 'Abdullah (Ibn Majah) said: \"I heard Abul-Hasan Tanafisi say: 'I heard 'Abdur-Rahman Al-Muharibi say: \"This Hadith should be sent to every teacher so that they can teach it to the children in the schools.\"</b>",
