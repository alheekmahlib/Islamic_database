Rather we will leave you to deal with it yourself. Go yourself and tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about your problem.' So I went out and when I came to him, I told him what happened. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Did you really do that?' I said: 'I really did that, and here I am, O Messenger of Allah. (ﷺ) I will bear Allah’s ruling on me with patience.' He said: 'Free a slave.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, I do not own anything but myself.' He said: 'Fast for two consecutive months.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the thing that happened to me was only because of fasting.' He said: 'Then give charity, or feed sixty poor persons.'
