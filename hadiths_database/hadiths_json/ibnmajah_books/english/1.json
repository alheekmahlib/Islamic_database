News of this report reached 'Abdullah bin 'Amr, and he said: \"By Allah, I never heard the Messenger of Allah say this, and Mu'adh will put you into difficulty with regard to relieving yourself.\" News of that reached Mu'adh, so he met with him ('Abdullah). Mu'adh said: \"O 'Abdullah! Denying a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah is hypocrisy, and its sn is upon the one who said it (if it is not true). I did indeed hear the Messenger of Allah say: 'Beware of the three things which provoke curses: Relieving oneself in watering places, in places of shade and in the middle of the street.'\"</b>",
