They all sent back a reply that they had nothing but water. The messenger of Allah ^ asked (his companions),\" Who will entertain this guest?\" One of the Ansar volunteered to serve the guest. This companion took him and said to his wife,\" Honour the guest of the Messenger of Allah.\" She responded that they only had the food of their children and nothing more. He said to her,\" Prepare to serve and set the lantern and send the children to sleep\". When they decided to have their meal, she laid the food on the cloth and set the lantern after putting her children to sleep. She then stood pretending to set right the lantern but, in the process, she extinguished it. Both husband and wife sat down leaving an impression on their guest that they were partaking the meal with him. Both of them passed the night in hunger. In the morning, that companion went to the Prophet (ﷺ) who said to him,\" Allah is pleased with your deed and revealed to me this verse: \" ... but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful.\" (al-Hashr,59:9)</b>",

He said, 'Your father is for Allah! How can these two be joined together?' I replied, 'In the Jahiliyya, a buried a daughter alive and I feared that I would meet you and you would say, \"There is no way for you to repent. There is no way out.\" On the other hand, I used to hope that you would say, \"There is a way for you to repent.

He then said,\" you go ahead, eat the food. And do not worry (about eating alone). For I am fasting,\" he stood up to offer prayers and hurried to the bowing posture. After he had \nfinished his prayer, he began to eat. Nuaym exclaimed, \"We belong to Allah! I had given no thought to it that you would lie to me. You said just now that you were fasting and you have come to eat\". \n\nHe said,\"Your father is for Allah! Ever since I have met you, I have not spoken a lie.\" Nuaym said, \"Did you not tell me that you were fasting?\" He said,\"Yes.
