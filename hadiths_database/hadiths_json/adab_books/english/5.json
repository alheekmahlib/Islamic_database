By Allah,\nI wish that I had seen what you have seen and witnessed what you have witnessed!'\nThis angered al-Miqdad and that surprised me as the man had said nothing\nbut good things.

By Allah, if certain people had been with the\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Allah would\nhave thrown them on their faces into Hellfire since they would neither have\nanswered nor confirmed him? Do you not praise Allah Almighty since He brought\nyou forth and you only know your Lord and confirm what your Prophet, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, brought? You see enough affliction in\nother people. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant\nhim peace, was sent in the harshest state in which any Prophet was ever sent\n- in a gap (in the line of prophethood) and the time of Ignorance. They\ndid not believe that the deen was better than worshipping idols. He brought\nthe Discrimination by which it is possible to discriminate between the true\nand false, and which can part a father from his child. Then a man will think\nof his father, child or brother as an unbeliever. Allah has loosened the\nlocks of his heart by faith and he knows that the other person will be destroyed\nin the Fire. Therefore his eye is not cool since he knows that the one he\nloves will be in the Fire. It is what Allah says, \"Those who say, 'Our\nLord, give us joy in our wives and children.\" (25:74)'\"</b>",
