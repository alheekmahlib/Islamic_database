'A'isha exclaimed, \"I vow\nto Allah that I will never again speak a single word to Ibn az-Zubayr!\" When this desertion lasted long, 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sought intercession from the Mahajireen with her, but she said: \"By Allah I will not ever accept the intercession of anyone for him, and I will not ever break my vow that I have vowed.\" When it went on long for Ibn Az-Zubair, he spoke to Al-Miswar bin Makhramah and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin Yaghut and they were from Bani Zuhrah. So he said to them: \"I beseech you in the Name of Allah that you enter me upon (the place of) 'Aishah because it is unlawful for her to vow to sever relations with me.\" So Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman approached with him under their upper garments until they sought her permission, saying: \"As-salamu 'alaiki wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu! Shall we come in?\" 'Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: \"Come in,\" They asked: \"All of us, o mother of the believers?\" She said: \"Yes all of you,\" and she did know that Ibn Az-Zubair was with them. So, when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and hugged 'Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) and began beseeching her and wept. And Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman began to plead her to but speak to him and to accept from him, also saying to her: \"You know that the Messenger Allah ï·º forbade what you know of abandonment and that it is not permissible for a man to abandon his brother over three nights.\" He said: So when they did a great deal of reminding and urging, she began remind them and weep, saying: \"I have made a vow which is a matter of very serious nature.\" They persisted in their appeal till she spoke with 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair. Then she freed forty slaves as an expiation for breaking her vow. Later on she would remember, after freeing forty slaves, then she would weep so much that her veil would become wet with tears.</b>",
