He said, ''Abdullah, is it hard on you to be kept waiting\nat your door.' I said, 'I asked permission from you three times and you\ndid not give me permission, so I went away (and we were commanded to do\nthat).' 'Umar said, 'From whom did you hear this?' I replied, 'I heard\nit from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' 'Umar said,\n'Did you hear something from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant\nhim peace, which I did not hear? If you do not bring me a clear proof,\nI will make an example of you!' Therefore I went to a group of Ansar who\nwere sitting in the mosque. I asked them and they said, 'Does anyone doubt\nthis?' I told them what 'Umar had said. They said, 'Only the youngest of\nus will go with you.' So Abu Sa'id al-Khudri - or Abu Mas'ud -\nwent with me to 'Umar. He said, 'We went out with the Prophet, may Allah\nbless him and grant him peace, when he was going to Sa'd ibn 'Ubada. He\ngave the greeting, but Sa'd did not give permission. Then he greeted him\na second time and then a third time, but Sa'd did not give him permission.\nSo the Prophet said, 'We have done what we must.' Then he went back and\nSa'd caught up to him and said, 'Messenger of Allah! By the One who sent\nyou with the Truth, every time you greeted me, I heard and answered you,\nbut I wanted to have a lot of greeting (peace) from you for me and the\npeople of my house.'\" Abu Musa said, \"By Allah, I am a guardian of the\nhadith of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.\"\n'Umar said, \"Yes, but I wanted to make sure.\"</b>",
