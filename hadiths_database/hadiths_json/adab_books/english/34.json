Are you resentful towards Allah? Do you keep pace with\nthe Messenger of Allah?' I said, 'May my mother and father be your ransom,\nI do not hold any resentment against Allah. I have every blessing.' The\nProphet came to the graves of the idolaters and said, 'These people have\nmissed a lot of good. Then he came to the graves of the Muslims and said,\n'These people have obtained much good.' There was a man wearing ox-hide\nsandals walking between the graves. The Prophet said, 'You with the ox-hide\nsandals! Remove your sandals!' So he removed his sandals.\"</b>",
