The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) said: He (Samurah) has refused to testify for you, so take an oath with your other witness.  I said: Yes. He then dictated an oath to me and I swore to the effect that we had embraced Islam on a certain day, and that we had cut the sides of the ears of the cattle.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Holy Prophet (ﷺ) said: Go and divide half of their property, but do not touch their children.
