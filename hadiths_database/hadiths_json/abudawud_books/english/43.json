Their survivors are to be found in cells and monasteries. (Then he quoted:) \"Monasticism, they invented it; we did not prescribe it for them.\"  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nNext day he went out in the morning and said: will you not go out for a ride, so that you may see something and take a lesson from it?  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: Yes. Then all of them rode away and reached a land whose inhabitants had perished, passed away and died. The roofs of the town had fallen in.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe asked: Do you know this land?  I said: Who acquainted me with it and its inhabitants?  (Anas said:) This is the land of the people whom oppression and envy destroyed. Envy extinguishes the light of good deeds, and oppression confirms or falsifies it.

He loves concealment. The people had neither curtains nor curtained canopies in their houses. Sometimes a servant, a child or a female orphan of a man entered while the man was having sexual intercourse with his wife. So Allah commanded them to ask permission in those times of undress.

The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) gave him permission and ordered him to take his weapon with him. He came to his house and found his wife standing at the door of the house. When he pointed to her with the lance, she said; do not make haste till you see what has brought me out. He entered the house and found an ugly snake there. He pierced in the lance while it was quivering. He said : I do not know which of them died first, the man or the snake. His people then came to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and said: supplicate Allah to restore our companion to life for us. He said : Ask forgiveness for your Companion. Then he said : In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam, so when you see one of them, pronounce a waring to it three times and if it appears to you after that, kill it after three days.</b>",
