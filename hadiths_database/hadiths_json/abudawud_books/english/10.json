        "hadithText": "Sahl bin Sa’d said : `Ali bin Abi Talib entered upon Fatimah while Hasan and Husain were crying. He asked: Why are they crying?  She replied: Due to hunger.  ‘Ali went out and found a dinar in the market.  He then came to Fatima and told her about it.  She said:  Go to such and such a Jew and get some flour for us.  He came to the Jew and purchased flour with it.  He said : Are you the son-in-law of him who believes that he is the Messenger of Allah.  He said : Yes.  The Jew said : Have your dinar with you and you will get the flour.  Ali then went out and came to Fatima.  He told her about the matter.  She then said: Go to such and such a butcher and get some meat for us for a dirham.  Ali went out and pawned the dinar for a dirham with him and got the meat, and brought it (to her).  She then kneaded the flour, put the utensil on fire and baked the bread.  She sent for her father : (i.e. the Prophet (SWAS).  He came to them.  She said to him : Messenger of Allah, I tell you all the matter.  If you think it is lawful for us, we shall eat it and you will eat with us.  She said: The matter is such and such.  He said: eat in the name of Allah.  So they ate it.  While they were (eating) at their place, a boy cried adguring in the name of Allah and Islam: He was searching the dinar.  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded and he was called in.  He asked him.  The boy replied, I lost it somewhere in the market.  The Prophet (SWAS) said : `Ali, go to the butcher and tell him that the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) has asked you : send the dinar to me and one dirham of yours will be due on me.  The butcher returned it and the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) handed it to him (the boy).</b>",
