For Indeed, You are the One Who Decrees, and I do not decree, and You know, and I do not know, and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah, if you know this, and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah, if you know this - here he should name exactly what he wishes - is better for me with regard to my religion, and my life, and my afterlife, and the end result of my affairs, then decree it to me, and make it easy for me, and bless me on it. O Allah, and if You know this to be evil for me - and he says just as he said the first time - then avert it for me, and avert me from it. And decree for me good wherever it might be, the make me content with it.\" A version goes: \"If the work is good immediately or subsequently.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIbn Maslamah and Ibn 'Isa reported from Muhammad b. al-Munkadir on the authority of Jabir.\n</p></b>",
