I said: What is this?  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe (the people) said: This is the banner of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). So I came to him. He was (sitting) under a tree. A sheet of cloth was spread for him and he was sitting on it. His Companions were gathered around him. I sat with them.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned illness and said: When a believer is afflicted by illness and Allah cures him of it, it serves as an atonement for his previous sins and a warning to him for the future.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nBut when a hypocrite becomes ill and is then cured, he is like a camel which has been tethered and then let loose by its owners, but does not know why they tethered it and why they let it loose.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nA man from among those around him asked: Messenger of Allah, what are illnesses? I swear by Allah, I never fell ill.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Get up and leave us. You do not belong to our number. When we were with him, a man came to him. He had a sheet of cloth and something in his hand.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe turned his attention to him and said: Messenger of Allah, when I saw you, I turned towards you. I saw a group of trees and heard the sound of fledglings. I took them and put them in my garment. Their mother then came and began to hover round my head. I showed them to her, and she fell on them. I wrapped them with my garment. They are now with me.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: Put them away from you. So I put them away, but their mother stayed with them.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his companions: Are you surprised at the affection of the mother for her young?  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThey said: Yes, Messenger of Allah.  He said: I swear by Him Who has sent me with the Truth, Allah is more affectionate to His servants than a mother to her young ones. Take them back put them and where you took them from when their mother should have been with them. So he took them back.\n</p></b>",

A bier passed and a large number of people were accompanying it.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThey said: Bier of Abdullah ibn Umayr. So I followed it. Suddenly I saw a man, who had a thin garment on riding his small mule. He had a piece of cloth on his head to protect himself from the sun.  I asked: Who is this important man? People said: This is Anas ibn Malik. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen the bier was placed, Anas stood and led the funeral prayer over him while I was just behind him, and there was no obstruction between me and him. He stood near his head, and uttered four takbirs (Allah is Most Great). He neither lengthened the prayer nor hurried it. He then went to sit down. They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then sat down.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAl-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say the funeral prayer over the dead as you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a woman?  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Messenger of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath of allegiance to him for Islam.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nA man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said: I make a vow to myself that if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword) that day, I shall behead him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive).  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen he saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he said: Messenger of Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance, so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to wait for the order of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for his murder. He was afraid of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to kill him. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of allegiance.  The man said: Messenger of Allah, what about my vow?  He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so that you might fulfil your vow.  He said: Messenger of Allah, why did you not give any signal to me?  The Prophet (ﷺ) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women. So the imam used to stand opposite the hips of a woman to hide her from the people.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said: The saying of the Prophet (ﷺ) \"I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: There is no god bu Allah\" abrogated this tradition of fulfilling the vow by his remark: \"I have repented\".\n</p></b>",
