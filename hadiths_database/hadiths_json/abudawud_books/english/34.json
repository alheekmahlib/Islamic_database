He said: Do not look down upon any good work, and when you speak to your brother, show him a cheerful face. This is a good work. Have your lower garment halfway down your shin; if you cannot do it, have it up to the ankles. Beware of trailing the lower garment, for it is conceit and Allah does not like conceit. And if a man abuses and shames you for something which he finds in you, then do not shame him for something which you find in him; he will bear the evil consequences for it.\n</p></b>",

There was in Damascus a man from the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), called Ibn al-Hanzaliyyah. He was a recluse and rarely met the people. He remained engaged in prayer. When he was not praying he was occupied in glorifying Allah and exalting Him until he went to his family. Once he passed us when we were with AbudDarda'.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: Tell us a word which benefits us and does not harm you.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent out a contingent and it came back. One of the men came and sat in the place where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to sit, and he said to a man beside him: Would that you saw us when we met the enemy and so-and-so attacked and cut through a lance.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: Take it from me and I am a boy of the tribe Ghifar. What do you think about his statement?  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe replied: I think his reward was lost.  Another man heard it and said: I do not think that there is any harm in it.  They quarrelled until the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) heard it, and he said: Glory be to Allah! There is no harm if he is rewarded and praised. I saw that AbudDarda' was pleased with it and began to raise his hand to him and say: Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: Yes. He continued to repeat it to him so often that I thought he was going to kneel down. He said: On another day he again passed us.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to us: One who spends on (the maintenance of) horses (for jihad) is like the one who spreads his hand to give alms (sadaqah) and does not withhold it. He then passed us on another day.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does no harm to you.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Khuraym al-Asadi would be a fine man were it not for the length of his hair, which reaches the shoulders, and the way he lets his lower garment hang down. When Khuraym heard that, he hurriedly, took a knife, cut his hair in line with his ears and raised his lower garment half way up his legs. He then passed us on another day.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: (tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: You are coming to your brethren; so tidy your mounts and tidy your dress, until you are like a mole among the people. Allah does not like obscene words or deeds, or do intentional committing of obscenity.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said: Similarly, Abu Nu'aim narrated from Hisham.

So we went and said to her: Mother of Faithful, Abu Talhah has transmitted to us a tradition so-and-so. Have you heard the Prophet (ﷺ) mentioning that ? She replied: No but I tell what I saw him doing. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went on an expedition and I was waiting for his return. I got a carpet which I hung as a screen on a stick over the door. When he came I received him and said: Peace be upon you, Messenger of Allah, His mercy and His blessings. Praise to be Allah Who gave you dominance and respect. Then he looked at the house and saw the carpet; and he did not respond to me at all. I found (signs of) disapproval in his face. He then came to the carpet and tore it down. He then said: Allah has not commanded us to clothe stones and clay out of the sustenance He has given us. She said: I then cut it to pieces and made two pillows out of it and stuffed them with palm fibre, and he did not disapprove of it to me.</b>",
