The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) performed only one hajj. Hence the people differed among themselves. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out (from Medina) with the intention of performing hajj. When he offered two rak'ahs of prayer in the mosque at Dhul-Hulayfah, he made it obligatory by wearing it.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAt the same meeting, he raised his voice in the talbiyah for hajj, when he finished his two rak'ahs. Some people heard it and I retained it from him. He then rode (on the she-camel), and when it (the she-camel) stood up, with him on its back, he raised his voice in the talbiyah and some people heard it at that moment. This is because the people were coming in groups, so they heard him raising his voice calling the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and they thought that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proceeded further; when he ascended the height of al-Bayda' he raised his voice in the talbiyah. Some people heard it at that moment. They thought that he had raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'. I swear by Allah, he raised his voice in the talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nSa'id (ibn Jubayr) said; He who follows the view of Ibn Abbas raises his voice in talbiyah (and ihram) at the place of is prayer after he finishes two rak'ahs of his prayer.\n</p></b>",

Some people of my tribe sent sacrificial animals with me as an offering. When we reached the people of Syria, they stopped us from entering the sacred territory. I, therefore, sacrificed the animals at the same spot. I then took off ihram and returned. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nNext year I came out to make an atonement for my umrah. I came to Ibn Abbas and asked him (about it). He said: Bring a new sacrificial animal, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered his companions to bring fresh sacrificial animals for the umrah of atonement in lieu of the animals they had sacrificed in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah.\n</p></b>",

When he reached Dhu al-Hulaifah he said : Anyone who wants to perform Hajj should raise his voice in Talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram); and he who wants to perform `Umrah should raise his voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah.  The narrator Musa in the version of Wuhaib reported him (the Prophet) as saying if there were no sacrificial animals with me, I would raise my voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah.  But according to the version of Hammad bin Salamah, he said as for myself, I shall raise my voice in talbiyah for Hajj because I have sacrificial animal with me.  The agreed version goes I (Ai’shah) was one of those persons who wore Ihram for an ‘Umrah.  But on my way (to Makkah) I menstruated.  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) entered upon me while I was weeping.  He asked why are you weeping?  I wished I would not come out (for Hajj) this year.  He said give up your `Umrah; untie your hair and comb.  The version of Musa said and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram).  Sulaiman’s version goes and do as all the Muslims do during their Hajj.  When the night for performing the obligatory circumambulation (tawaf al-Ziyarah) came, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded `Abd al-Rahman.  He took her to al-Tan’im (instead of the words “her ‘Umrah”).  She went round the Ka’bah.  Allah thus completed both her ‘Umrah and Hajj.\n</p>\n<p>\n\nHisham said : No sacrificial animal was offered during all this time.  \n</p>\n<p>\nIn the version of Hammad bin Salamah, the narrator Musa added when the night of al-Batha came Ai’ shah was purified. \n</p></b>",

There remained only four days to perform Hajj at ‘Arafah. We then raised our voice in talbiyah (wearing Ihram for Hajj) on the eighth of Dhu al Hijjah. The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) entered upon A’ishah and found her weeping. He said What is the matter with you? My problem is that I have menstruated, while the people have put on their ihram but I have not done so, nor did I go round the House(the Ka’bah). Now the people are proceeding for Hajj. He said This is a thing destined by Allah to the daughters of Adam. Take a bath, then raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj(i.e, wear ihram for Hajj). She took a abtah and performed all the rites of the Hajj(lit. she stayed at all those places where the pilgrims stay). When she was purified, she circumambulated the House (the Ka’bah), and ran between al Safa’ and al Marwah. He (the Prophet) said “Now you have performed both your Hajj and your ‘Umrah. She said Messenger of Allah, I have some misgiving in my mind that I did not go round the Ka’bah when I performed Hajj (in the beginning). He said ‘Abd al Rahman (her brother), take her and have her perform ‘Umrah from Al Tan’im. This happened on the night of Al Hasbah(i.e., the fourteenth of Dhu Al Hijjah).</b>",

He then said Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) remained nine years (at Madeenah ) during which he did not perform Hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was about to (go to) perform Hajj. A large number of people came to Madeenah everyone desiring to follow him and act like him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went out and we too went out with him till we reached Dhu Al Hulaifah. Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr. She sent message to Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) asking him What should I do?He replied “take a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth and put on ihram.” The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then prayed (in the masjid) and mounted Al Qaswa’ and his she Camel stood erect with him on its back. Jabir said “I saw (a large number of) people on mounts and on foot in front of him and a similar number on his right side and a similar number on his left side and a similar number behind him. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was among us, the Qur’an was being revealed to him and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did, we did it. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then raised his voice declaring Allaah’s unity and saying “Labbaik ( I am at thy service), O Allaah, labbaik, labbaik, Thou hast no partner praise and grace are Thine and the Dominion. Thou hast no partner. The people too raised their voices in talbiyah which they used to utter. But the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) did not forbid them anything. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) continued his talbiyah. Jabir said “We did not express our intention of performing anything but Hajj, being unaware of ‘Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House (the Ka’bah), he touched the corner (and made seven circuits) walking quickly with pride in three of them and walking ordinarily in four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham he recited “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (While praying two rak’ahs) he kept the station between him and the House. The narrator said My father said that Ibn Nufail and ‘Uthman said I do not know that he (Jabir) narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (ﷺ). The narrator Sulaiman said I do not know but he (Jabir) said “The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) used to recite in the two rak’ahs “Say, He is Allaah, one” and “Say O infidels”. He then returned to the House (the ka’bah) and touched the corner after which he went out by the gate to Al Safa’. When he reached near Al Safa’ he recited “Al Safa’ and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah” and he added “We begin with what Allaah began with”. He then began with Al Safa’ and mounting it till he could see the House (the Ka’bah) he declared the greatness of Allaah and proclaimed his Unity. He then said “there is no god but Allaah alone, Who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates. He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards Al Marwah and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached Al Marwah. He did at al Marwah as he had done at Al Safa’ and when he came to Al Marwah for the last time, he said “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an ‘Umrah, so if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may take off ihram and treat it as an ‘Umrah. All the people then took off ihram and clipped their hair except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had brought sacrificial animals. Suraqah (bin Malik) bin Ju’sham then got up and asked Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)does this apply to the present year or does it apply for ever? The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) interwined his fingers and said “The ‘Umarh has been incorporated in Hajj. Adding ‘No’, but forever and ever. ‘Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) and found Fathima among one of those who had taken off their ihram. She said put on colored clothes and stained her eyes with collyrium. ‘Ali disliked (this action of her) and asked Who commanded you for this? She said “My father”. Jabir said ‘Ali said at Iraq I went to Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) to complain against Fathima for what she had done and to ask the opinion of Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) about which she mentioned to me. I informed him that I disliked her action and that thereupon she said to me “My father commanded me to do this.” He said “She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth.” What did you say when you put on ihram for Hajj? I said O Allaah, I put on ihram for the same purpose for which Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) has put it on. He said I have sacrificial animals with me, so do not take off ihram. He (Jabir) said “The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (ﷺ) from Madeenah was one hundred.” Then all the people except the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who had with them the sacrificial animals took off ihram and clipped their hair. When the 8th of Dhu Al Hijjah (Yaum Al Tarwiyah) came, they went towards Mina having pit on ihram for Hajj and the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) rode and prayed at Mina the noon, afternoon, sunset, night and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namrah. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then sent out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at Al Mash ‘ar Al Haram at Al Muzdalifah, as the Quraish used to do in the pre Islamic period but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafah and found that the tent had been setup at Namrah. There he dismounted and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered Al Qaswa’ to be brought and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people saying “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in the month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to the pre Islamic period has been put under my feet and claims for blood vengeance belonging to the pre Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I permit is the blood vengeance of ours (according to the version of the narrator ‘Uthman, the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi’ah and according to the version of the narrator Sulaiman the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi’ah bin Al Harith bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib). Some (scholars) said “he was suckled among Banu Sa’d(i.e., he was brought up among Bani Sa’d) and then killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre Islamic period is abolished and the first of usury I abolish is our usury, the usury of ‘Abbas bin ‘Abd Al Muttalib for it is all abolished. Fear Allaah regarding women for you have got them under Allah’s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allaah’s word. It is a duty from you on them not to allow anyone whom you dislike to lie on your beds but if they do beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something by which if you hold to it you will never again go astray, that is Allaah’s Book. You will be asked about me, so what will you say? They replied “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said “O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness! Bilal then uttered the call to prayer and the iqamah and he prayed the noon prayer, he then uttered the iqamah and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted (his she Camel) al Qaswa’ and came to the place of standing , making his she Camel Al Qaswa‘ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him and he faced the qiblah. He remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usamah up behind him and picked the reins of Al Qaswa’ severely so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with is right hand he was saying “Calmness, O People! Calmness, O people. Whenever he came over a mound (of sand) he let loose its reins a little so that it could ascend. He then came to Al Muzdalifah where he combined the sunset and night prayers, with one adhan and two iqamahs. The narrator ‘Uthamn said He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer when the morning light was clear. The narrator Sulaiman said with one adhan and one iqamah. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then mounted Al Qaswa’ and came to Al Mash’ar Al Haram and ascended it. The narrators ‘Uthaman and Sulaiman said He faced the qiblah praised Allaah, declared His greatness, His uniqueness. ‘Uthamn added in his version and His Unity and kept standing till the day was very clear. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then went quickly before the sun rose , taking Al Fadl bin ‘Abbas behind him. He was a man having beautiful hair, white and handsome color. When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went quickly, the women in the howdas also began to pass him quickly. Al Fadl began to look at them. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) placed his hand on the face of Al Fadl , but Al fadl turned his face towards the other side. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) also turned away his hand to the other side. Al Fadl also turned his face to the other side looking at them till he came to (the Valley of) Muhassir. He urged the Camel a little and following a middle road which comes out at the greatest jamrah, he came to the jamrah which is beside the tree and he threw seven small pebbles at this (jamrah) saying “Allah is most great” each time he threw a pebble like bean seeds. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. The Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) then went to the place of the sacrifice  and sacrificed sixty three Camels with his own hand. He then commanded ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder and he shared him and his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each Camel should be put in a pot and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. The narrator Sulaiman said the he mounted afterwards the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) went quickly to the House (the Ka’bah) and prayed the noon prayer at Makkah. He came to Banu ‘Abd Al Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said draw water Banu ‘Abd Al Muttalib were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you. So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it.</b>",
