He had kept it  with his sword. So AbuBakr acted upon it till he died, and then Umar acted upon it till he died.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nIt contained: \"For five camels one goat is to be given; for ten camels two goats are to be given; for fifteen camels three goats are to be given; for twenty camels four goats are to be given; for twenty-five to thirty-five camels a she-camel in her second year is to be given. If the number exceeds by one up to seventy camels, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to seventy-five camels, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to ninety camels, two she-camels in their third year are to be given; if they exceed by one up to one hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year are to be given. If the camels are more than this, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty camels, and a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty camels.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nFor forty to one hundred and twenty goats one goat is to be given; if they exceed by one up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed by one up to three hundred, three goats are to be given; if the goats are more than this, one goat for every hundred goats is to be given. Nothing is payable until they reach one hundred. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are in separate flocks are not be brought together from fear of sadaqah (zakat). Regarding that which belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from each other with equity. An old goat and a defective one are not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat).\"  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAz-Zuhri said: When the collector comes, the goats will be apportioned into three flocks: one containing bad, the second good, and the third moderate. The collector will take zakat from the moderate. Az-Zuhri did not mention the cows (to be apportioned in three flocks).\n</p></b>",

But if you possess only thirty-nine, nothing is payable on them.\" He further narrated the tradition about the sadaqah (zakat) on sheep like that of az-Zuhri.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\n\"Regarding cattle, a yearling bull calf is payable for every thirty, and a cow in her third year for forty, and nothing is payable on working animals.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nRegarding (the zakat on) camels, he mentioned the rates that az-Zuhri mentioned in his tradition.

If there is no she-camel in her second year, a male camel in its third year is to be given, up to thirty-five. If they exceed by one a she-camel in her third year is to be given, up to forty-five. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a bull-camel is to be given.\" He then transmitted the rest of the tradition like that of az-Zuhri.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe continued: If they exceed by one, i.e. they are ninety-one to hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year, which are ready to be covered by a bull-camel, are to be given. If there are more camels than that, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are separate are not to be brought together. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a billy goat is not to be accepted as a sadaqah unless the collector is willing.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAs regards agricultural produce, a tenth is payable on that which is watered by rivers or rain, and a twentieth on that which is watered by draught camels.\"  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe version of Asim and al-Harith says: \"Sadaqah (zakat) is payable every year.\" Zuhayr said: I think he said \"Once a year\".  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe version of Asim has the words: \"If a she-camel in her second year is not available among the camels, nor is there a bull-camel in its third year, ten dirhams or two goats are to be given.\"\n</p></b>",

When he had collected his property of camels, I found that a she-camel in her second year was due from him.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nI said to him: Pay a she-camel in her second year, for she is to be paid as sadaqah (zakat) by you.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: That one is not worthy of milking and riding. Here is another she-camel which is young, grand and fat. So take it.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nI said to him: I shall not take an animal for which I have not been commanded. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is here near to you. If you like, go to him, and present to him what you presented to me. Do that; if he accepts it from you, I shall accept it; if he rejects it, I shall reject it.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nHe said: I shall do it. He accompanied me and took with him the she-camel which he had presented to me. We came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said to him: Prophet of Allah, your messenger came to me to collect zakat on my property. By Allah, neither the Messenger of Allah nor his messenger has ever seen my property before. I gathered my property (camels), and he estimated that a she-camel in her second year would be payable by me. But that has neither milk nor is it worth riding. So I presented to him a grand young she-camel for acceptance as  zakat. But he has refused to take her. Look, she is here; I have brought her to you, Messenger of Allah. Take her.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: That is what is due from you. If you give voluntarily a better (animal) Allah will give a reward to you for it. We accept her from you.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nShe is here, Messenger of Allah; I have brought her to you. So take her.

He presumed that Abu Bakr had written it for Anas when he sent him (to Al Bahrain) as a collector of zakat. This (letter) was stamped with the stamp of the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) and was written by Abu Bakr for him(Anas). This letter goes “This is the obligatory sadaqah(zakat) which the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) imposed on Muslims which Allah commanded his Prophet(ﷺ) to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For less than twenty five Camels a goat is to be given for every five Camels. When they reach twenty five to thirty five, a she Camel in her second year is to be given. If there is no she Camel in her second year, a male Camel in its third year is to be given. When they reach thirty six to forty five, a she Camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty six to sixty , a she Camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty one to seventy five, a she Camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy six to ninety, two she Camel in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety one to a hundred and twenty, two she Camels in their fourth year are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she Camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she Camel in her fourth year for every fifty(Camels). In case the ages of the Camel vary in the payment of obligatory sadaqah(zakat) If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possess one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said From here I could not retain accurately from Musa as I liked “And he must give along with it two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable possesses only one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him.” </p><p>\nAbu Dawud said (I was doubtful) up to here, and retained correctly onward “and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, but he must give two goats or twenty dirhams. Anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her second year is payable does not possess one but possesses a male Camel in its third year, that will be accepted from him, and nothing extra will be demanded along with it. If anyone possesses only four Camels, no zakat will be payable on them unless their owner wishes. If the numbers of the pasturing goats reach forty to one hundred and twenty, one goat is to be given. Over one hundred and twenty up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed two hundred reaching three hundred, three goats are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a goat is to be for every hundred. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat) unless the collector wishes. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of sadaqah(zakat). Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity, If a man’s pasturing animals are less than forty, no sadaqah(zakat) is due on them unless their owner wishes. On sliver dirhams a fortieth is payable, but if there are only a hundred and ninety, nothing is payable unless their owner wishes.”\n</p></b>",

The contents of this tradition were narrated by one of them or the other. The embryo of a Camel is called huwar; when it is born it is called fasil. When it is in its second year it is called bink makhad up to the completion of two years. When two years are completed it is called hiqq or hiqqah up to the completion of four years. The reason for this nomenclature is that a she Camel in her fourth year becomes worthy of riding and worthy of being covered by a stallion. The she Camel becomes worthy of covering, but the male Camel does not become worthy of covering till it reaches the age of six years. The hiqqah is also called taruqat al fahl because a stallion covers her. This is up to four years. When it is in its fifth year it is called jadha’ah till five years are completed. When it enters the sixth year and weans its front teeth it is called thani till it completed sixth year. When it enters its seventh year the male is called raba’iaad the she Camel is called raba’iyyah till the completion of the seventh year. When it enters the eight year and weans its sixth tooth, it is called sadis and sadas till the completion of its eighth year. When it enters its ninth year, it weans the canine teeth, it is then called bazil. i.e. It weaned the canine tooth, till it enters the tenth year. It is then called mukhlif. There is no further name for it, but it is called ba’zil ‘am(bazil of one year) and ba’zil amain(bazil of two years) and mukhlif thalathah a’wam(three years) up to five years. Al Khalifah means a pregnant she Camel.\r\n\r\nAbu Hatim said Judhu’ah refers to a period of time; it does not mean tooth. The time of the ages of the Camels changes with the rise of Canopus (Suhail). Abu dawud said Al Riyashi recited the following verses: When the Canopus rises at the first night, the male Camel in its third year (ibn labun) becomes a male Camel in its fourth year(hiqq) and the male Camel in its fourth year becomes one in its fifth year(jadha’un). There is no age of Camel which is not counted (from the rise of Canopus) except huba’. Huba’ is a Camel born at a time other than the rise of Canopus (the age of huba’ is not counted from the rise of Canopus).",

I call you as witness that I dedicate my land at Ariha ‘to Him’. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him Divide it among your nearest relatives. So he divided it among Hassan bin Thabit and Ubayy bin Ka’b.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said I have been gold by an Ansari Muhammad bin ‘Abdallah that the name of Abu Talhah is Zaid bin Sahal bin al-Aswad bin Haram bin ‘Amar bin Zaid bin Manat bin ‘Adi bin ‘Amr bin Malik bin al-Najjar; and Hassan bin Tabit is son of al-Mundhir in al-Haram.  Thus both of them (Abu Talhah and Hassan) have their common link in Haram who is the third great grandfather. Ubbay bin Ka’b is son of Qais bin ‘Atik bin Zaid bin Mu’awiyah bin ‘Amr bin Malik bin al-Najjar.  Thus the common tie between Hassan, Abu Talhah and Ubbay is ‘Amr (bin Malik). The Ansari said between Ubbay and Abi Talhah there are six great grandfathers.\n</p></b>",
