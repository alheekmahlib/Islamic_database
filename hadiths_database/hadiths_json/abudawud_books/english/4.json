We offered the noon prayer.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThereupon, the unbelievers said: We suffered from negligence; we became careless. We should have attacked them while they were praying. Thereupon the verse was revealed, relating to the shortening of the prayer (in time of danger) between the noon and afternoon (prayer).  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen the time of the afternoon prayer came, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood facing the qiblah, and the unbelievers were standing in front of him. The people stood in a row behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and there was another row behind this row. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bowed and all of them bowed. He then prostrated and also the row near him prostrated. The other people in the second row remained standing and stood guard over them. When they performed two prostrations and stood up, those who were behind them prostrated. The people in the front row near him then stepped backward taking the place of the people in the second row and the second row took the place of the first row.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then bowed and all of them bowed together. Then he and the row near him prostrated themselves. The other people in the second row remained standing and stood guard over them. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the row near him (i.e. the front row) were seated, the people in the second row behind them prostrated themselves. Then all of them were seated. (He (the Prophet) then uttered the salutation upon all of them. He prayed in his manner at Usfan as well as at the territory of Banu Sulaym.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Ayyub and Hisham from Abu al-Zubair on the authority of Jabir to the same effect from the Prophet (ﷺ). Similarly, this has been transmitted by Dawud b. Husain from 'Ikrimah, on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. This has also been reported by 'Abd al-Malik, from 'Ata' from Jabir in like manner. This has also been narrated by Qatadah from al-Hasan from Hittan on the authority of Abu Musa in a similar way. Similarly, this has been reported by 'Ikrimah b.

Then those who were with him went away and took the position of their companions before the enemy. Then they came and prayed behind him. He led them in two rak'ahs and uttered the salutation. Thus the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered four rak'ahs and his companions offered two rak'ahs. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n\nAl-Hasan used to give legal verdict on the authority of this tradition.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said: This will be so in the sunset prayer. The imam will offer six rak'ahs and the people three rak'ahs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbu Dawud said: Yahya b. Abi Kathir narrated from Abu Salamah from Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ) something similar. Sulaiman al-Yashkuri reported it from the Prophet (ﷺ) in like manner.\n</p></b>",

I saw him when the time of the afternoon prayer had come. I said: I am afraid if a fight takes place between me and him (Khalid b. Sufyan), that might delay the prayer. I proceeded walking towards him while I was praying by making a sign. When I reached near him, he said to me: Who are you ? I replied: A man from the Arabs; it came to me that you were gathering (any army) for this man (i.e. Prophet). Hence I came to you in connection with this matter. He said: I am (engaged) in this (work). I then walked along with him for a while ; when it became convenient for me, I dominated him with my sword until he became cold (dead).</b>",
