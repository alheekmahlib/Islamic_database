Do not harm the people. Fear\nthe supplication of the wronged, for the supplication of the wronged\nis answered. Let the one with a small herd of camels and the one with\na small herd of sheep enter, but be wary of the livestock of Ibn Awf\nand the livestock of Ibn Affan. If their livestock are destroyed, they\nwill return to palm-trees and agriculture. If the livestock of the one\nwith a small herd of camels and the one with a small herd of sheep are\ndestroyed, he will bring his children to me crying, 'Amir al-muminin!\nAmir al-Muminin!' Shall I neglect them? Water and pasturage are of\nless value to me than gold and silver. By Allah, they think that I\nhave wronged them. This is their land and their water. They fought for\nit in the jahiliyya and became muslims on it in Islam. By He in whose\nhand my self is! Were it not for the mounts which I give to be ridden\nin the way of Allah, I would not have turned a span of their land into\nhima.\"\n</p></b>",
