        "hadithText": "<p> Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of doing things among us in the case of slave whose master makes a bequest to free part of him - a third, a fourth, a half, or any share after his death, is that only the portion of him is freed that his master has named. This is because the freeing of that portion is only obliged to take place after the death of the master because the master has the option to withdraw the bequest as long as he lives. When the slave is freed from his master, the master is a testator and the testator only has access to free what he can take from his property, being the third of the property he is allowed to bequeath, and the rest of the slave is not free because the man's property has gone out of his hands. How can the rest of the slave which belongs to other people be free when they did not initiate the setting free and did not confirm it and they do not have the wala' established for them? Only the deceased could do that. He was the one who freed him and the one for whom the wala' was confirmed. That is not to be borne by another's property unless he bequeaths within the third of his property what remains of a lave to be freed. That is a request against his partners and inheritors and the partners must not refuse the slave that when it is within the third of the dead man's property because there is no harm in that to the inheritors.\" </p> <p> Malik said, \"If a man frees a third of his slave while he is critically ill, he must complete the emancipation so all of him is free from him, if it is within the third of his property that he has access to, because he is not treated in the same way as a man who frees a third of a slave after his death, because had the one who freed a third of his slave after his death lived, he could have cancelled it and the slave's being set free would be of no effect. The master who made the freeing of the third of the slave irrevocable in his illness, would still have to free all of him if he lived. If he died, the slave would be set free within the third of the bequest. That is because the command of the deceased is permissible in his third as the command of the healthy is permissible in all his property.\" </p></b>",

A'isha said, 'If your people agree that I pay it all to them for\nyou, and that if I pay it, your wala' is mine, then I will do it.'\nBarira went to her masters and told them that and they didn't agree.\nShe came back from her masters while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah\nbless him and grant him peace, was sitting. She said to A'isha, 'I\noffered that to them and they refused me unless they had the wala'.'\nThe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard\nthat and asked her about it A'isha told him and the Messenger of\nAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Take her and\nstipulate that the wala' is yours, for the wala' is for the one who\nsets free.' So A'isha did that and then the Messenger of Allah, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, stood up in front of the people,\nand praised Allah and gave thanks to Him. Then he said, 'What is wrong\nwith the people who make conditions which are not in the Book of\nAllah? Any condition which is not in the Book of Allah is invalid even\nif it is a hundred conditions. The decree of Allah is truer and the\nconditions of Allah are firmer, and the wala' only belongs to the one\nwho sets free.' \"\n</p></b>",

Said said, \"If their father dies and he is a slave who was not set free, their wala' belongs to the mawali of their mother.\" </p> <p> Malik said, \"That is like the child of a woman who is a mawla who has been divorced by lian; the child is attached to the mawali of his mother and they are his mawali. If he dies, they inherit from him. If he commits a crime, they pay the blood-money for him. If his father acknowledges him, he is given a kinship to him and his wala' goes to the mawali of his father. They are his heirs, they pay his blood-money and his father is punished with the hadd-punishment.\" </p> <p> Malik said, \"It is like that with a free-born woman divorced by lian. If her husband who curses her by lian does not acknowledge her child, the child is dealt with in the same way except that the rest of his inheritance after the inheritance of his mother and his brothers from his mother goes to all the muslims as long as he was not given kinship to his father. The child of the lian is attached to the patronage of the mawali of his mother until his father acknowledges him because he does not have a lineage or paternal relations. If his lineage is confirmed, it goes to his paternal relations.\" </p> <p> Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of doing things among us about a child of a slave by a free woman, while the father of the slave is free, is that the grandfather (the father of the slave), attracts the wala' of his son's free children by a free woman. They leave their inheritance to him as long as their father is a slave. If the father becomes free, the wala' returns to his mawali. If he dies and he is still a slave, the inheritance and the wala' go to the grandfather. If the slave has two free sons, and one of them dies while the father is still a slave, the grandfather, the father of the father, attracts the wala' and the inheritance.\" </p> <p> Malik spoke about a slave-girl who was set free while she was pregnant and her husband was a slave and then her husband became free before she gave birth, or after she gave birth. He said, \"The wala' of what is in her womb goes to the person who set the mother free because slavery touched the child before the mother was set free. It is not treated in the same way as a child conceived by its mother after she has been set free because the wala' of such a child, is attracted by the father when he is set free.\" </p> <p> Malik said that if a slave asked his master's permission to free a slave of his and his master gave permission, the wala' of the freed slave went to the master of his master, and his wala' did not return to the master who had set him free, even if he were to become free himself.\" </p></b>",
