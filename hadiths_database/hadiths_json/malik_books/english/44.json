The jews came and he said, \"By\nAllah! You have killed him.\" They said, \"By Allah! We have not killed\nhim!\" Then he made for his people and mentioned that to them. Then he,\nhis brother Huwayyisa, who was older than him, and Abd ar-Rahman, set\nout. Muhayyisa began to speak, as he had been at Khaybar. The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to\nhim, \"The greater first, the greater first,\" meaning in age. So\nHuwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa spoke. The Messenger of Allah, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Either they pay your\ncompanion's blood-money or we will declare war against them.\" The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wrote\nthat to them and they wrote, \"By Allah, we did not kill him!\" The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to\nHuwayyisa, Muhayyisa, and Abd ar-Rahman, \"Do you swear and claim the\nblood of your companion?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Shall the jews\nswear to you?\" They said, \"But they are not muslims.\" The Messenger of\nAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave blood-money from\nhis own property, and sent them one hundred camels to their house.\n</p>\n<p>\nSahl added, \"A red camel among them kicked me.\"\n</p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya said from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that Bushayr ibn Yasar\ninformed him that Abdullah ibn Sahl al-Ansari and Muhayyisa ibn Masud\nwent out to Khaybar, and they separated on their various businesses\nand Abdullah ibn Sahl was killed. Muhayyisa, and his brother Huwayyisa\nand Abd ar-Rahman ibn Sahl went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him\nand grant him peace, and Abd ar-Rahman began to speak before his\nbrother. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\npeace, said, \"The older first, the older first. \n</p>\n<p>\nTherefore\nHuwayyisa and then Muhayyisa spoke and mentioned the affair of\nAbdullah ibn Sahl. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and\ngrant him peace, said to them, \"Do you swear with fifty oaths and\nclaim the blood-money of your companion or the life of the murderer?\"\nThey said, \"Messenger of Allah, we did not see it and we were not\npresent.\" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\npeace, said, \"Will you acquit the jews for fifty oaths?' They said,\n\"Messenger of Allah, how can we accept the oaths of a people who are\nkafirun?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya ibn Said said, \"Bushayr ibn Yasar claimed\nthat the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,\npaid the blood-money from his own property.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The\ngenerally agreed on way of doing things in our community and that\nwhich I heard from whoever I am content with, concerning the oath of\nqasama, and upon which the past and present imams agree, is that those\nwho claim revenge begin with the oaths and swear. The oath for revenge\nis only obligatory in two situations. Either the slain person says,\n'My blood is against so-and-so,' or the relatives entitled to the\nblood bring a partial proof of it that is not irrefutable against the\none who is the object of the blood-claim. This obliges taking an oath\non the part of those who claim the blood against those who are the\nobject of the blood-claim. With us, swearing is only obliged in these\ntwo situations.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"That is the sunna in which\nthere is no dispute with us and which is still the behaviour of the\npeople. The people who claim blood begin the swearings, whether it is\nan intentional killing or an accident.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, began\nwith Banu Harith in the case of the killing of their kinsman murdered\nat Khaybar.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If those who make the claim swear,\nthey deserve the blood of their kinsman and whoever they swear against\nis slain. Only one man can be killed in the qasama. Two cannot be\nkilled in it. Fifty men from the blood-relatives must swear fifty\noaths. If their number is less or some of them draw back, they can\nrepeat their oaths, unless one of the relatives of the murdered man\nwho deserves blood and who is permitted to pardon it, draws back. If\none of these draws back, there is no way to revenge.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya\nsaid that Malik said, \"The oaths can be made by those of them who\nremain if one of them draws back who is not permitted to pardon. If\none of the blood-relatives draws back who is permitted to pardon, even\nif he is only one, more oaths can not be made after that by the blood-\nrelatives. If that occurs, the oaths can be on behalf of the one\nagainst whom the claim is made. So fifty of the men of his people\nswear fifty oaths. If there are not fifty men, more oaths can be made\nby those of them who already swore. If there is only the defendant, he\nswears fifty oaths and is acquitted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik\nsaid, \"One distinguishes between swearing for blood and oaths for\none's rights. When a man has a money-claim against another man, he\nseeks to verify his due. When a man wants to kill another man, he does\nnot kill him in the midst of people. He keeps to a place away from\npeople. Had there only been swearing in cases where there is a clear\nproof and had one acted in it as one acts about one's rights (i.e.\nneeding witnesses), the right of blood retribution would have been\nlost and people would have been swift to take advantage of it when\nthey learned of the decision on it. However, the relatives of the\nmurdered man were allowed to initiate swearing so that people might\nrestrain themselves from blood and the murderer might beware lest he\nwas put into a situation like that (i.e. qasama) by the statement of\nthe murdered man.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said, \"Malik said about a people\nof whom a certain number are suspected of murder and the relatives of\nthe murdered man ask them to take oaths and they are numerous, so they\nask that each man swears fifty oaths on his own behalf. The oaths are\nnot divided out between them according to their number and they are\nnot acquitted unless each man among them swears fifty oaths on his own\nbehalf.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"This is the best I have heard about the\nmatter.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said, \"Swearing goes to the paternal relatives of\nthe slain. They are the blood-relatives who swear against the killer\nand by whose swearing he is killed.\"\n</p></b>",

If the murdered man only has\nfemale relatives, the women have no right to swear for blood and no\npardon in murder.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said about a man who\nis murdered, \"If the paternal relatives of the murdered man or his\nmawali say, 'We swear and we demand our companion's blood,' that is\ntheir right.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If the women want to pardon him,\nthey cannot do that. The paternal relatives and mawali are entitled to\ndo that more than them because they are the ones who demand blood and\nswear for it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If the paternal relatives or\nmawali pardon after they demand blood and the women refuse and say,\n'We will not abandon our right against the murderer of our companion,'\nthe women are more entitled to that because whoever takes retaliation\nis more entitled than the one who leaves it among the women and\npaternal relatives when the murder is established and killing\nobliged.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"At least two claimants must swear in\nmurder. The oaths are repeated by them until they swear fifty oaths,\nthen they have the right to blood. That is how things are done in our\ncommunity.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"When people beat a man and he dies\nin their hands, they are all slain for him. If he dies after their\nbeating, there is swearing. If there is swearing, it is only against\none man and only he is slain. We have never known the swearing to be\nagainst more than one man.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a slave who had\nhis hand or foot broken and then the break mended . He said, \"The one\nwho injured him is not obliged to pay anything. If that break causes\nhim loss or scar, the one who injured him must pay according to what\nhe diminished of the value of the slave.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What\nis done in our community about retaliation between slaves is that it\nis like retaliation between freemen. The life of the slave-girl for\nthe life of the slave, and her injury for his injury. When a slave\nintentionally kills a slave, the master of the murdered slave has a\nchoice. If he wishes, he kills him, and if he wishes, he takes the\nblood-money. If he takes the blood-money, he takes the value of his\nslave. If the owner of the slave who killed wishes to give the value\nof the murdered slave, he does it. If he wishes, he surrenders his\nslave. If he surrenders him, he is not obliged to do anything other\nthan that. When the owner of the murdered slave takes the slave who\nmurdered and is satisifed with him, he must not kill him. All\nretaliations between slaves for cutting off of the hand and foot and\nsuch things are dealt with in the same way as in the murder.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said about a muslim slave who injures a jew or christian, \"If\nthe master of the slave wishes to pay blood-money for him according to\nthe injury, he does it. Or else he surrenders him and he is sold, and\nthe jew or christian is given the blood-money of the injury or all the\nprice of the slave if the blood-money is greater than his price. The\njew or christian is not given a muslim slave.\"\n</p></b>",

If he swears fifty oaths then he has the right\nto his portion of the blood-money. That is because the blood-money is\nnot established as due without there being fifty oaths, and the blood-\nmoney is not established as due unless the responsibility for the\nblood is established. If any one of the heirs comes after that he\nswears a number of the oaths commensurate with his fraction of the\ninheritance and takes his right until all the heirs exact their\ncomplete right. If a maternal uncle comes he has one sixth and must\nswear one sixth of the fifty oaths. So whoever swears may take his due\nfrom the blood-money and whoever abstains annuls his right.
