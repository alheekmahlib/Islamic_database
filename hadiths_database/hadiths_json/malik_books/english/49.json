The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him\nand grant him peace, said to those with him, 'Let us go.' He set off\nand I went among them until I came to Abu Talha and told him. Abu\nTalha said, 'Umm Sulaym! The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him\nand grant him peace, has brought people and we have no food. What\nshall we give them to eat?' She said, 'Allah and His Messenger know\nbest.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnas continued, \"Abu Talha went out and met the\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,\napproached with Abu Talha until they entered.

The Messenger of Allah, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, ordered it to be broken into\npieces, and Umm Sulaym squeezed out onto it a container of clarified\nbutter which she had seasoned. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah\nbless him and grant him peace, said whatever Allah wished him to say,\nand said, 'Will you give permission for ten of them to come in?'
