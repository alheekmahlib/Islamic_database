If I do not purchase the goods or hire the animal,\nthen what I have given you is yours without liability on your part.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"According to the way of doing things with us\nthere is nothing wrong in bartering an arabic speaking merchant slave\nfor abyssinian slaves or any other type that are not his equal in\neloquence, trading, shrewdness, and know-how. There is nothing wrong\nin bartering one slave like this for two or more other slaves with a\nstated delay in the terms if he is clearly different. If there is no\nappreciable difference between the slaves, two should not be bartered\nfor one with a stated delay in the terms even if their racial type is\ndifferent.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is nothing wrong in selling\nwhat has been bought in such a transaction before taking possession of\nall of it as long as you receive the price for it from some one other\nthan the original owner.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"An addition to the\nprice must not be made for a foetus in the womb of its mother when she\nis sold because that is gharar (an uncertain transaction). It is not\nknown whether the child will be male or female, good-looking or ugly,\nnormal or handicapped, alive or dead. All these things will affect the\nprice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that in a transaction where a slave or\nslave-girl was bought for one hundred dinars with a stated credit\nperiod that if the seller regretted the sale there was nothing wrong\nin him asking the buyer to revoke it for ten dinars which he would pay\nhim immediately or after a period and he would forgo his right to the\nhundred dinars which he was owed.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"However, if\nthe buyer regrets and asks the seller to revoke the sale of a slave or\nslave-girl in consideration of which he will pay an extra ten dinars\nimmediately or on credit terms, extended beyond the original term,\nthat should not be done. It is disapproved of because it is as if, for\ninstance, the seller is buying the one hundred dinars which is not yet\ndue on a year's credit term before the year expires for a slave-girl\nand ten dinars to be paid immediately or on credit term longer than\nthe year. This falls into the category of selling gold for gold when\ndelayed terms enter into it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that it was not\nproper for a man to sell a slave-girl to another man for one hundred\ndinars on credit and then to buy her back for more than the original\nprice or on a credit term longer than the original term for which he\nsold her. To understand why that was disapproved of in that case, the\nexample of a man who sold a slave-girl on credit and then bought her\nback on a credit term longer than the original term was looked at. He\nmight have sold her for thirty dinars with a month to pay and then buy\nher back for sixty dinars with a year or half a year to pay. The\noutcome would only be that his goods would have returned to him just\nlike they were and the other party would have given him thirty dinars\non a month's credit against sixty dinars on a year or half a year's\ncredit. That was not to be done.\n</p></b>",

This\nis possible because a master is not asked to pay zakat on his slave's\nproperty. If a slave has a slave-girl, it is halal for him to have\nintercourse with her by his right of possession.

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said from Salim ibn\nAbdullah that Abdullah ibn Umar sold one of his slaves for eight\nhundred dirhams with the stipulation that he was not responsible for\ndefects. The person who bought the slave complained to Abdullah ibn\nUmar that the slave had a disease which he had not told him about.\nThey argued and went to Uthman ibn Affan for a decision . The man\nsaid, \"He sold me a slave with a disease which he did not tell me\nabout.\" Abdullah said, \"I sold to him with the stipulation that I was\nnot responsible.\" Uthman ibn Affan decided that Abdullah ibn Umar\nshould take an oath that he had sold the slave without knowing that he\nhad any disease. Abdullah ibn Umar refused to take the oath, so the\nslave was returned to him and recovered his health in his possession.\nAbdullah sold him afterwards for 1500 dirhams.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us about a man\nwho buys a female slave and she becomes pregnant, or who buys a slave\nand then frees him, or if there is any other such matter which has\nalready happened so that he cannot return his purchase, and a clear\nproof is established that there was a fault in that purchase when it\nwas in the hands of the seller or the fault is admitted by the seller\nor someone else, is that the slave or slave-girl is assessed for its\nvalue with the fault it is found to have had on the day of purchase\nand the buyer is refunded,from what he paid,the difference between the\nprice of a slave who is sound and a slave with such a defect.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us\nregarding a man who buys a slave and then finds out that the slave has\na defect for which he can be returned and meanwhile another defect has\nhappened to the slave whilst in his possession, is that if the defect\nwhich occurred to the slave in his possession has harmed him, like\nloss of a limb, loss of an eye, or something similar, then he has a\nchoice. If he wants, he can have the price of the slave reduced\ncommensurate with the defect (he bought him with ) according to the\nprices on the day he bought him, or if he likes, he can pay\ncompensation for the defect which the slave has suffered in his\npossession and return him. The choice is up to him. If the slave dies\nin his possession, the slave is valued with the defect which he had on\nthe day of his purchase. It is seen what his price would really have\nbeen. If the price of the slave on the day of purchase without fault\nwas 100 dinars, and his price on the day of purchase with fault would\nhave been 80 dinars, the price is reduced by the difference. These\nprices are assessed according to the market value on the day the slave\nwas purchased . \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The generally agreed upon way\nof doing things among us is that if a man returns a slave girl in whom\nhe has found a defect and he has already had intercourse with her, he\nmust pay what he has reduced of her price if she was a virgin. If she\nwas not a virgin, there is nothing against his having had intercourse\nwith her because he had charge of her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The\ngenerally agreed upon way of doing things among us regarding a person,\nwhether he is an inheritor or not, who sells a slave, slave-girl, or\nanimal without a liability agreement is that he is not responsible for\nany defect in what he sold unless he knew about the fault and\nconcealed it. If he knew that there was a fault and concealed it, his\ndeclaration that he was free of responsibility does not absolve him,\nand what he sold is returned to him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a\nsituation where a slave-girl was bartered for two other slave-girls\nand then one of the slave-girls was found to have a defect for which\nshe could be returned. He said, \"The slave-girl worth two other slave-\ngirls is valued for her price. Then the other two slave-girls are\nvalued, ignoring the defect which the one of them has. Then the price\nof the slave-girl sold for two slave-girls is divided between them\naccording to their prices so that the proportion of each of them in\nher price is arrived at - to the higher priced one according to her\nhigher price, and to the other according to her value. Then one looks\nat the one with the defect, and the buyer is refunded according to the\namount her share is affected by the defect, be it little or great. The\nprice of the two slave-girls is based on their market value on the day\nthat they were bought.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who bought a\nslave and hired him out on a long-term or short-term basis and then\nfound out that the slave had a defect which necessitated his return.\nHe said that if the man returned the slave because of the defect, he\nkept the hire and revenue. \"This is the way in which things are done\nin our city. That is because, had the man bought a slave who then\nbuilt a house for him, and the value of the house was many times the\nprice of the slave, and he then found that the slave had a defect for\nwhich he could be returned, and he  was returned, he would not have to\nmake payment for the work the slave had done for him. Similarly, he\nwould keep any revenue from hiring him out, because he had charge of\nhim. This is the way of doing things among us.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"The way of doing things among us when someone buys several slaves in\none lot and then finds that one of them has been stolen, or has a\ndefect, is that he looks at the one he finds has been stolen or the\none in which he finds a defect. If he is the pick of those slaves, or\nthe most expensive, or it was for his sake that he bought them, or he\nis the one in whom people see the most excellence, then the whole sale\nis returned. If the one who is found to be stolen or to have a defect\nis not the pick of the slaves, and he did not buy them for his sake,\nand there is no special virtue which people see in him, the one who is\nfound to have a defect or to have been stolen is returned as he is,\nand the buyer is refunded his portion of the total price.\"\n</p></b>",

He said, \"There is no harm in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and\ngrant him peace, forbade muzabana. The explanation of muzabana is that\nit is buying something whose number, weight and measure is not known\nwith something whose number, weight or measure is known, for instance,\nif a man has a stack of food whose measure is not known, either of\nwheat, dates, or whatever food, or the man has goods of wheat, date\nkernels, herbs, safflower, cotton, flax, silk, and does not know its\nmeasure or weight or number and then a buyer approaches him and\nproposes that he weigh or measure or count the goods, but, before he\ndoes, he specifies a certain weight, or measure, or number and\nguarantees to pay the price for that amount, agreeing that whatever\nfalls short of that amount is a loss against him and whatever is in\nexcess of that amount is a gain for him. That is not a sale. It is\ntaking risks and it is an uncertain transaction. It falls into the\ncategory of gambling because he is not buying something from him for\nsomething definite which he pays. Everything which resembles this is\nalso forbidden.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that another example of that was,\nfor instance, a man proposing to another man, \"You have cloth. I will\nguarantee you from this cloth of yours so many hooded cloaks, the\nmeasureof each cloak to be such-and-such, (naming a measurement).\nWhatever loss there is, is against me and I will fulfill you the\nspecified amount and whatever excess there is, is mine.\" Or perhaps\nthe man proposed, \"I will guarantee you from this cloth of yours so\nmany shirts, the measurement of each shirt to be such-and-such, and\nwhatever loss there is, is against me and I will fulfill the specified\namount and whatever excess there is, is mine.\" Or perhaps a man\nproposed to a man who had cattle or camel hides, \"I will cut up these\nhides of yours into sandals on a pattern I will show you. Whatever\nfalls short of a hundred pairs, I will make up its loss and whatever\nis over is mine because I guaranteed you.\" Another example was that a\nman say to a man who had ben-nuts, \"I will press these nuts of yours.\nWhatever falls short of such-and-such a weight by the pound, I will\nmake it up, and whatever is more than that is mine.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid that all this and whatever else was like it or resembled it was\nin the category of muzabana, which was neither good nor permitted. It\nwas also the same case for a man to say to a man, who had fodder\nleaves, date kernels, cotton, flax, herbs or safflower, \"I will buy\nthese leaves from you in exchange for such-and-such a sa, (indicating\nleaves which are pounded like his leaves) . . or these date kernels\nfor such-and-such a sa of kernels like them, and the like of that in\nthe case of safflower, cotton, flax and herbs.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"All this is what we have described of muzabana.\"\n</p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no harm in buying dates from specified\ntrees or a specified orchard or buying milk from specified sheep when\nthe buyer starts to take them as soon as he has payed the price. That\nis like buying oil from a container. A man buys some of it for a dinar\nor two and gives his gold and stipulates that it be measured out for\nhim. There is no harm in that. If the container breaks and the oil is\nwasted, the buyer has his gold back and there is no transaction\nbetween them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no harm in everything\nwhich is taken right away as it is, like fresh milk and fresh picked\ndates which the buyer can take on a day-to-day basis. If the supply\nruns out before the buyer has what he has paid for in full, the seller\ngives him back the portion of the gold that is owed to him, or else\nthe buyer takes other goods from him to the value of what he is owed\nand which they mutually agree about. The buyer should stay with the\nseller until he has taken it. It is disapproved of for the seller to\nleave because the transaction would then come into the forbidden\ncategory of a debt for a debt. If a stated time period for payment or\ndelivery enters into the transaction, it is also disapproved. Delay\nand deferment are not permitted in it, and are only acceptable when it\nis standard practice on definite terms by which the seller guarantees\nit to the buyer, but this is not to be from one specific orchard or\nfrom any specific ewes.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik was asked about a man who\nbought an orchard from another man in which there were various types\nof palm-trees - excellent ajwa palms, good kabis palms, adhq palms and\nothertypes. The seller kept aside from the sale the produce of a\ncertain palm of his choice. Malik said, \"That is not good because if\nhe does that, and keeps aside, for instance, dates of the ajwa variety\nwhose yield would be 15 sa, and he picks the dates of the kabis in\ntheir place, and the yield of their dates is 10 sa or he picks the\najwa which yield 15 sa and leaves the kabis which yield 10 sa, it is\nas if he bought the ajwa for the kabis making allowances for their\ndifference of quality. This is the same as if a man dealing with a man\nwho has heaps of dates before him - a heap of 15 sa of ajwa, a heap of\n10 sa of kabis, and a heap of 12 sa of cadhq, gives the owner of the\ndates a dinar to let him choose and take whichever of the heaps he\nlikes.\" Malik said, \"That is not good.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik was asked what\na man who bought fresh dates from the owner of an orchard and advanced\nhim a dinar was entitled to if the crop was spoilt. Malik said, \"The\nbuyer makes a reckoning with the owner of the orchard and takes what\nis due to him of the dinar. If the buyer has taken two-thirds of a\ndinar's worth of dates, he gets back the third of a dinar which is\nowed him. If the buyer has taken three-quarters of a dinar's worth of\ndates, then he gets back the quarter which is owed to him, or they\ncome to a mutual agreement, and the buyer takes what is owed him from\nhis dinar from the owner of the orchard in something else of his\nchoosing. If, for instance, he prefers to take dry dates or some other\ngoods, he takes them according to what is due. If he takes dry dates\nor some other goods, he should stay with him until he has been paid in\nfull.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"This is the same situation as hiring out\na specified riding-camel or hiring out a slave tailor, carpenter or\nsome other kind of worker or letting a house and taking payment in\nadvance for the hire of the slave or the rent of the house or camel.\nThen an accident happens to what has been hired resulting in death or\nsomething else. The owner of the camel, slave or house returns what\nremains of the rent of the camel, the hire of the slave or the rent of\nthe house to the one who advanced him the money, and the owner reckons\nwhat will settle that up in full. If, for instance, he has provided\nhalf of what the man paid for, he returns the remaining half of what\nhe advanced, or according to whatever amount is due.\" Malik said,\n\"Paying in advance for something which is on hand is only good when\nthe buyer takes possession of what he has paid for as soon as he hands\nover the gold, whether it be slave, camel, or house, or in the case of\ndates, he starts to pick them as soon as he has paid the money.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is not good that there be any deferment or credit in such a\ntransaction.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"An example illustrating what is\ndisapproved of in this situation is that, for instance, a man may say\nthat he will pay someone in advance for the use of his camel to ride\nin the hajj, and the hajj is still some time off, or he may say\nsomething similar to that about a slave or a house. When he does that,\nhe only pays the money in advance on the understanding that if he\nfinds the camel to be sound at the time the hire is due to begin, he\nwill take it by virtue of what he has already paid. If an accident, or\ndeath, or something happens to the camel, then he will get his money\nback and the money he paid in advance will be considered as a loan.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"This is distinct from someone who takes\nimmediate possession of what he rents or hires, so that it does not\nfall into the category of 'uncertainty,' or disapproved payment in\nadvance. That is following a common practice. An example of that is\nthat a man buys a slave, or slave-girl, and takes possession of them\nand pays their price. If something happens to them within the period\nof the year indemnification contract, he takes his gold back from the\none from whom he bought it. There is no harm in that. This is the\nprecedent of the sunna in the matter of selling slaves.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Someone who rents a specified slave, or hires a specified\ncamel, for a future date, at which time he will take possession of the\ncamel or slave, has not acted properly because he did not take\npossession of what he rented or hired, nor is he advancing a loan\nwhich the person is responsible to pay back.\"\n</p></b>",

As for produce which is not\ndried and stored but is eaten fresh like water melon, cucumber, melon,\ncarrots, citron, medlars, pomegranates, and soon, which when dried no\nlonger counts as fruit, and is not a thing which is stored up as is\nfruit, I think that it is quite proper to barter such things two for\none of the same variety hand to hand. If no term enters into it, there\nis no harm in it.\"\n</p></b>",

He poured\nhis gold into one pan of the scales, and the man with whom he was\ncounterpoising put his gold in the other pan of the scale and when the\ntongue of the scales was balanced, they took and gave.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"According to the way things are done among us there is no harm\nin selling gold for gold, and silver for silver by counterpoising\nweight, even if 11 dinars are taken for 10 dinars hand to hand, when\nthe weight of gold is equal, coin for coin, even if the number is\ndifferent. Dirhams in such a situation are treated the same way as\ndinars.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If, when counterpoising gold for gold\nor silver for silver, there is a difference of weight, one party\nshould not give the other the value of the difference in silver or\nsomething else. Such a transaction is ugly and a means to usury\nbecause if one of the parties were permitted to take the difference\nfor a separate price, it could be as if he had bought it separately,\nso he would be permitted. Then it would be possible for him to ask for\nmany times the value of the difference in order to permit the\ncompletion of the transaction between the two parties.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"If he had really been sold the difference without anything else\nwith it, he would not have taken it for a tenth of the price for which\nhe took it in order to put a 'legal front' on the transaction. This\nleads to allowing what is forbidden . The matter is forbidden.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that it was not good when counterpoising to give good\nold gold coins and put along with them unminted gold in exchange for\nworn kufic gold, which was unpopular and to then treat the exchange as\nlike for like.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The commentary on why that is\ndisapproved is that the owner of the good gold uses the excellence of\nhis old gold coins as an excuse to throw in the unminted gold with it.\nHad it not been for the superiority of his (good) gold over the gold\nof the other party, the other party would not have counterpoised the\nunminted gold for his kufic gold, and the deal would have been\nrefused.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is like a man wanting to buy three sa of ajwa\ndried dates for two sa and a mudd of kabis dates, and on being told\nthat it was not good, then offering two sa of kabis and a sa of poor\ndates desiring to make the sale possible. That is not good because the\nowner of the ajwa should not give him a sa of ajwa for a sa of poor\ndates. He would only give him that because of the excellence of kabis\ndates.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Or it is like a man asking some one to sell him three\nsa of white wheat for two and a half sa of Syrian wheat, and being\ntold that it was not good except like for like, and so offering two sa\nof wheat and one sa of barley intending to make the sale possible\nbetween them. That is not good because no one would have given a sa of\nbarley for a sa of white wheat had that sa been by itself. It was only\ngiven because of the excellence of Syrian wheat over the white wheat.\nThis is not good. It is the same as the case of the unminted gold.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Where gold, silver and food, things which should\nonly be sold like for like, are concerned, something disliked and of\npoor quality should not be put with something good and desirable in\norder to make the sale possible and to make a bad situation halal.\nWhen something of desirable quality is put with something of poor\nquality and it is only included so that its excellence in quality is\nnoticed, something is being sold which if it had been sold on its own,\nwould not have been accepted and to which the buyer would not have\npaid any attention. It is only accepted by the buyer because of the\nsuperiority of what comes with it over his own goods. Transactions\ninvolving gold, silver, or food, must not have anything of this\ndescription enter into them. If the owner of the poor quality goods\nwants to sell them, he sells them on their own, and does not put\nanything with them. There is no harm if it is like that.\"\n</p></b>",

He does not buy anything else from the\nman for the same price until he has got back what he paid. That is\nbecause if he took something else besides the price which he paid him\nor exchanged it for goods other than the goods which he bought from\nhim, it would be selling food before getting delivery of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\npeace, forbade selling food before getting delivery of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that it was not good if the buyer regretted his purchase\nand asked the seller to revoke the sale for him and he would not press\nhim immediately for what he had paid. The people of knowledge forbade\nthat. That was because when the food was made ready for the buyer by\nthe seller, the buyer deferred his due from the seller in order that\nhe might revoke the sale for him. That was the sale of food with\ndelayed terms before taking delivery of the food.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"The explanation of that is that when the date of delivery comes and\nthe buyer dislikes the food, the seller takes by it money to be paid\nlater and so it is not revocation. Revocation is that in which neither\nthe buyer nor the seller is increased. When increase occurs by\ndeferment of payment for a time period, or by anything which increases\none of them over the other or anything which gives one of them profit,\nit is not revocation. When either of them do that, revocation becomes\na sale. There is an indulgence for revocation, partnership, and\ntransfer, as long as i ncrease, decrease, or deferment does not come\ninto them. If increase, decrease, or deferment comes into it, it\nbecomes a sale. Whatever makes a sale halal makes it halal and\nwhatever makes a sale haram makes it haram.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If\nsomeone pays in advance for Syrian wheat, there is no harm if he takes\na load after the term falls due.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"It is the same\nwith whoever advances for any kind of thing. There is no harm in him\ntaking better than whatever he has made an advance for or worse than\nit after the agreed delivery date. The explanation of that is that if,\nfor instance, a man advances for a certain weight of wheat. There is\nno harm if he decides to take some barley or Syrian wheat. If he has\nmade an advance for good dates, there is no harm if he decides to take\npoor quality dates. If he paid in advance for red raisins, there is no\nharm if he takes black ones, when it happens after the agreed delivery\ndate, and when the measure of what he takes is like the measure of\nwhat he paid for in advance.\"\n</p></b>",

If there is any sort of delayed terms\nin the transaction, it is not good. It is haram. Condiments are not\nbartered except from hand to hand.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Food and\ncondiments are not bartered when they are the same type, two of one\nkind for one of the other. A mudd of wheat is not sold for two mudds\nof wheat, nor a mudd of dates for two mudds of dates, nor a mudd of\nraisins for two mudds of raisins, nor is anything of that sort done\nwith grains and condiments when they are of one kind, even if it is\nhand to hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"This is the same position as silver for silver\nand gold for gold. No increase is halal in the transaction, and only\nlike for like, from hand to hand is halal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If\nthere is a clear difference in foodstuffs which are measured and\nweighed, there is no harm in taking two of one kind for one of\nanother, hand to hand. There is no harm in taking a sa of dates for\ntwo sa of wheat, and a sa of dates for two sa of raisins, and a sa of\nwheat for two sa of ghee. If the two sorts in the transaction are\ndifferent, there is no harm in two for one or more than that from hand\nto hand.

There is no harm in a heap of wheat for a heap of dates,\nfrom hand to hand.

There is\nno harm in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"It is not good for someone to\nmake a heap of food, knowing its measure and then to sell it as if it\nhad not been measured precisely, concealing its measure from the\nbuyer. If the buyer wants to return that food to the seller, he can,\nbecause he concealed its measure and so it is an uncertain\ntransaction. This is done with any kind of food or other goods whose\nmeasure and number the seller knows, and which he then sells without\nmeasurement and the buyer does not know that. If the buyer wants to\nreturn that to the seller, he can return t. The people of knowledge\nstill forbid such a transaction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no\ngood in selling one round loaf of bread for two round loaves, nor\nlarge for small when some of them are bigger than others.

The owner of the milk puts the milk with his butter so that\nhe can use the superiority of his butter over the butter of the other\nparty to put his milk in with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Flour for\nwheat is like for like, and there is no harm in that. That is if he\ndoes not mix up anything with the flour and sell it for wheat, like\nfor like. Had he put half a mudd of flour and half of wheat, and then\nsold that for a mudd of wheat, it would be like what we described, and\nit would not be good because he would want to use the superiority of\nhis good wheat to put flour along with it.

The one who owed the food said to his creditor, \"I\nwill refer you to my debtor who owes me the same amount of food as I\nowe you, so that you may obtain the food which I owe you .\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If the man who had to deliver the food, had gone out, and\nbought the food to pay off his creditor, that is not good. That is\nselling food before taking possession of it. If the food is an advance\nwhich falls due at that particular time, there is no harm in paying\noff his creditor with it because that is nota sale. It is not halal to\nsell food before receiving it in full since the Messenger of Allah,\nmay Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade that. However, the\npeople of knowledge agree that there is no harm in partnership,\ntransfer of responsibility and revocation in sales of food and other\ngoods.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"That is because the people of knowledge\nconsider it as a favour rendered. They do not consider it as a sale.\nIt is like a man lending light dirhams. He is then paid back in\ndirhams of full weight, and so gets back more than he lent. That is\nhalal for him and permitted. Had a man bought defective dirhams from\nhim as being the full weight, that would not be halal. Had it been\nstipulated to him that he lend full weight in dirhams, and then he\ngave faulty ones, that would not be halal for him.\"\n</p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that al-Qasim\nibn Muhammad said, ''I heard Abdullah ibn Abbas say, when a man asked\nhim about a man making an advance on some garments and then wanting to\nsell them back before taking possession of them, 'That is silver for\nsilver,' and he disapproved of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Our opinion\nis - and Allah knows best that was because he wanted to sell them to\nthe person from whom he had bought them for more than the price for\nwhich he bought them. Had he sold them to some one other than the\nperson from whom he had purchased them, there would not have been any\nharm in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The generally agreed on way of\ndoing things among us concerning making an advance for slaves, cattle\nor goods is that when all of what is to be sold is described and an\nadvance is made for them for a date, and the date falls due, the buyer\ndoes not sell any of that to the person from whom he has purchased it\nfor more than the price which he advanced for it before he has taken\nfull possession of what he has advanced for. It is usury if he does.\nIf the buyer gives the seller dinars or dirhams and he profits with\nthem, then, when the goods come to the buyer and he does not take them\ninto his possession but sells them back to their owner for more than\nwhat he advanced for them, the outcome is that what he has advanced\nhas returned to him and has been increased for him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"If someone advances gold or silver for described animals or\ngoods which are to be delivered before a named date, and the date\narrives, or it is before or after the date, there is no harm in the\nbuyer selling those goods to the seller, for other goods, to be taken\nimmediately and not delayed, no matter how extensive the amount of\nthose goods is, except in the case of food because it is not halal to\nsell it before he has full possession of it. The buyer can sell those\ngoods to some one other than the person from whom he purchased them\nfor gold or silver or any goods. He takes possession of it and does\nnot defer it because if he defers it, that is ugly and there enters\ninto the transaction what is disapproved of: delay for delay. Delay\nfor delay is to sell a debt against one man for a debt against another\nman.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If someone advances for goods to be\ndelivered after a time, and those goods are neither something to be\neaten nor drunk, he can sell them to whomever he likes for cash or\ngoods, before he takes delivery of them, to some one other than the\nperson from whom he purchased them. He must not sell them to the\nperson from whom he bought them except in exchange for goods which he\ntakes possession of immediately and does not defer.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"If the delivery date for the goods has not arrived, there is no\nharm in selling them to the original owner for goods which are clearly\ndifferent and which he takes immediate possession of and does not\ndefer.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about the case of a man who advanced\ndinars or dirhams for four specified pieces of cloth to be delivered\nbefore a specified time and when the term fell due, he demanded\ndelivery from the seller and the seller did not have them. He found\nthat the seller had cloth but inferior quality, and the seller said\nthat he would give him eight of those cloths. Malik said, \"There is no\nharm in that if he takes the cloths which he offers him before they\nseparate. It is not good if delayed terms enter into the transaction.\nIt is also not good if that is before the end of the term, unless he\nsells him cloth which is notthetypeof cloth for which he made an\nadvance.\n</p></b>",

There is no harm in\ntaking a ritl of iron for two ritls of iron, and a ritl of brass for\ntwo ritls of brass.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no good in two for\none of one sort with delayed terms. There is no harm in taking two of\none sort for one of another on delayed terms, if the two sorts are\nclearly different. If both sorts resemble each other but their names\nare different, like lead and black lead, brass and yellow brass, I\ndisapprove of taking two of one sort for one of the other on delayed\nterms.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"When buying something of this nature,\nthere is no harm in selling It beforetaking possession of it to some\none other than the person from whom it was purchased, if the price is\ntaken immediately and if it was bought originally by measure or\nweight. If it was bought without measuring, it should be sold to\nsomeone other than the person from whom it was bought, for cash or\nwith delayed terms. That is because goods have to be guaranteed when\nthey are bought without measuring, and they cannot be guaranteed when\nbought by weight until they are weighed and the deal is completed.\nThis is the best of what I have heard about all these things. It is\nwhat people continue to do among us.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The way of\ndoing things among us with what is measured or weighed of things which\nare not eaten or drunk, like safflower, date-stones, fodder leaves,\nindigo dye and the like of that is that there is no harm in bartering\nall those sort of things two for one, hand to hand. Do not take two\nfor one from the same variety with delayed terms. If the types are\nclearly different, there is no harm in taking two of one for one of\nthe other with delayed terms. There is no harm in selling whatever is\npurchased of all these sorts, before taking delivery of them if the\nprice is taken from someone other than the person from whom they were\npurchased.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Anything of any variety that profits\npeople, like gravel and gypsum, one quantity of them for two of its\nlike with delayed terms is usury. One quantity of both of them for its\nequal plus any increase with delayed terms, is usury.\"\n</p></b>",

A man says, 'I will take him from you for twenty\ndinars.' If the buyer finds him, thirty dinars goes from the seller,\nand if he does not find him, the seller takes twenty dinars from the\nbuyer.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is another fault in that. If that\nstray is found, it is not known whether it will have increased or\ndecreased in value or what defects may have befallen it. This\ntransaction is greatly uncertain and risky.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"According to our way of doing things, one kind of uncertain\ntransaction and risk is selling what is in the wombs of females -\nwomen and animals - because it is not known whether or not it will\ncome out, and if it does come out, it is not known whether it will be\nbeautiful or ugly, normal or disabled, male or female. All that is\ndisparate. If it has that, its price is such-and-such, and if it has\nthis, its price is such-and-such.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Females must\nnot be sold with what is in their wombs excluded. That is that, for\ninstance, a man says to another, 'The price of my sheep which has much\nmilk is three dinars. She is yours for two dinars while I will have\nher future offspring.' This is disapproved because it is an uncertain\ntransaction and a risk.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"It is not halal to sell\nolives for olive oil or sesame for sesame oil, or butter for ghee\nbecause muzabana comes into that, because the person who buys the raw\nproduct for something specified which comes from it, does not know\nwhether more or less will come out of that, so it is an uncertain\ntransaction and a risk.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"A similar case is the\nselling of ben-nuts for ben-nut oil. This is an uncertain transaction\nbecause what comes from the ben-nut is ben-oil. There is no harm in\nselling ben-nuts for perfumed ben because perfumed ben has been\nperfumed, mixed and changed from the state of raw ben-nut oil.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik, speaking about a man who sold goods to a man on the\nprovision that there was to be no loss for the buyer, (i.e. if the\nbuyer could not re-sell the goods they could go back to the seller),\nsaid, \"This transaction is not permitted and it is part of risk. The\nexplanation of why it is so, is that it is as if the seller hired the\nbuyer for the profit if the goods make a profit. If he sells the stock\nat a loss, he has nothing, and his efforts are not compensated. This\nis not good. In such a transaction, the buyer should have a wage\naccording to the work that he has contributed. Whatever there is of\nloss or profit in those goods is for and against the seller. This is\nonly when the goods are gone and sold. If they do not go, the\ntransaction between them is null and void.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"As\nfor a man who buys goods from a man and he concludes the sale and then\nthe buyer regrets and asks to have the price reduced and the seller\nrefuses and says, 'Sell it and I will compensate you for any loss.'\nThere is no harm in this because there is no risk. It is something he\nproposes to him, and their transaction was not based on that. That is\nwhat is done among us.\"\n</p></b>",

As\nfor the cost of transporting the drapery, it is included in the basic\nprice, and no share of the profit is allocated to it unless the agent\ntells all of that to the investor. If they agree to share the profits\naccordingly after knowledge of it, there is no harm in that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"As for bleaching, tailoring, dyeing, and such things,\nthey are treated in the same way as drapery. The profit is reckoned in\nthem as it is reckoned in drapery goods. So if he sells the drapery\ngoods without clarifying the things we named as not getting profit,\nand if the drapery has already gone, the transport is to be reckoned,\nbut no profit is given.

If the goods had been\nsold, he had the price for which the salesman bought them, and the\nsalesman was reckoned to have the profit on what they were bought for,\nover what the investor gained as profit.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If a\nman sells goods worth one hundred dinars for one hundred and ten, and\nhe hears after that they are worth ninety dinars, and the goods have\ngone, the seller has a choice.

He is given the\nchoice between what his goods fetch and the capital plus the profit,\nwhich is ninety-nine dinars.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If someone sells\ngoods in murabaha and he says, 'It was valued at one hundred dinars to\nme.'

If he wishes, he gives the\nsalesman the value of the goods on the day he took them, and if he\nwishes, he gives the price for which he bought them according to the\nreckoning of what profit he gives him, as far as it goes, unless that\nis less than the price for which he bought them, for he should not\ngive the owner of the goods a loss from the price for which he bought\nthem because he was satisfied with that.

If the man paid, he took it. If not, he increased him in his debt\nand lengthened the term for him .\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The\ndisapproved of way of doing things about which there is no dispute\namong us, is that a man should give a loan to a man for a term, and\nthen the demander reduce it and the one from whom it is demanded pay\nit in advance. To us that is like someone who delays repaying his debt\nafter it is due to his creditor and his creditor increases his debt.\"\nMalik said, \"This is nothing else but usury. No doubt about it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who loaned one hundred dinars to a man for\ntwo terms. When it was due, the person who owed the debt said to him,\n\"Sell me some goods, whose price is one hundred dinars in cash for one\nhundred and fifty on credit.\" Malik said, \"This transaction is not\ngood, and the people of knowledge still forbid it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"This is disapproved of because the creditor himself gives the\ndebtor the price of what the man sells him, and he defers repayment of\nthe hundred of the first transaction for the debtor for the term which\nis mentioned to him in the second transaction, and the debtor\nincreases him with fifty dinars for his deferring him. That is\ndisapproved of and it is not good. It also resembles the hadith of\nZayd ibn Aslam about the transactions of the people of the Jahiliyya.\nWhen their debts were due, they said to the person with the debt,\n'Either you pay in full or you increase it.'

Then the seller failed him about the date,\nand the buyer wanted to return those goods to the seller. Malik said,\n\"The buyer cannot do that, and the sale is binding on him. If the\nseller does bring the goods before the completion of the term, the\nbuyer cannot be forced to take them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a\nperson who bought food and measured it. Then some one came to him to\nbuy it and he told him that he had measured it for himself and taken\nit in full. The new buyer wanted to trust him and accept his measure.\nMalik said, \"Whatever is sold in this way for cash has no harm in it\nbut whatever is sold in this way on delayed terms is disapproved of\nuntil the new buyer measures it out for himself. The sale with delayed\nterms is disapproved of because it leads to usury and it is feared\nthat it will be circulated in this way without weight or measure. If\nthe terms are delayed it is disapproved of and there is no\ndisagreement about that with us.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"One should not\nbuy a debt owed by a man whether present or absent, without the\nconfirmation of the one who owes the debt, nor should one buy a debt\nowed to a man by a dead person even if one knows what the deceased man\nhas left. That is because to buy that is an uncertain transaction and\none does not know whether the transaction will be completed or not\ncompleted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said, \"The explanation of what is disapproved\nof in buying a debt owed by someone absent or dead, is that it is not\nknown what unknown debtor may be connected to the dead person. If the\ndead person is liable for another debt, the price which the buyer gave\non strength of the debt may become worthless.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"There is another fault in that as well. He is buying something which\nis not guaranteed for him, and so if the deal is not completed, what\nhe paid becomes worthless. This is an uncertain transaction and it is\nnot good.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"One distinguishes between a man who\nis only selling what he actually has and a man who is being paid in\nadvance for something which is not yet in his possession. The man\nadvancing the money brings his gold which he intends to buy with. The\nseller says, 'This is 10 dinars. What do you want me to buy for you\nwith it?' It is as if he sold 10 dinars cash for 15 dinars to be paid\nlater. Because of this, it is disapproved of. It is something leading\nto usury and fraud.\"\n</p></b>",

That is\nbecause two garments can be alike in marking and be greatly different\nin price.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The way of doing things among us is\nthat there is no harm in partnership, transferring responsibility to\nan agent, and revocation when dealing with food and other things,\nwhether or not possession was taken, when the transaction is with\ncash, and there is no profit, loss, or deferment of price in it. If\nprofit or loss or deferment of price from one of the two enters any of\nthese transactions, it becomes sale which is made halal by what makes\nsale halal, and made haram by what makes sale haram, and it is not\npartnership, transferring responsibility to an agent, or revocation.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about some one who bought drapery goods or\nslaves, and the sale was concluded, then a man asked him to be his\npartner and he agreed and the new partner paid the whole price to the\nseller and then something happened to the goods which removed them\nfrom their possession. Malik said, \"The new partner takes the price\nfrom the original partner and the original partner demands from the\nseller the whole price unless the original partner stipulated on the\nnew partner during the sale and before the transaction with the seller\nwas completed that the seller was responsible to him. If the\ntransaction has ended and the seller has gone, the pre-condition of\nthe original partner is void, and he has the responsibility.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who asked another man to buy certain goods to\nshare between them, and he wanted the other man to pay for him and he\nwould sell the goods for the other man. Malik said, \"That is not good.\nWhen he says, 'Pay for me and I will sell it for you,' it becomes a\nloan which he makes to him in order that he sell it for him and if\nthose goods are destroyed, or pass, the man who paid the price will\ndemand from his partner what he put in for him. This is part of the\nadvance which brings in profit.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If a man buys\ngoods, and they are settled for him, and then a man says to him,\n'Share half of these goods with me, and I will sell them all for you,'\nthat is halal, there is no harm in it.

It is the seller's right if he has received any of the price\nfrom the buyer and he wants to return it to take what he finds of his\nwares, and in what he does not find, he is like the creditors.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about some one who bought spun wool or a plot of land,\nand then did some work on it, like building a house on the plot of\nland or weaving the spun wool into cloth. Then he went bankrupt after\nhe had bought it, and the original owner of the plot said, \"I will\ntake the plot and whatever structure is on it.\" Malik said, \"That\nstructure is not his. However, the plot and what is in it that the\nbuyer has improved is appraised. Then one sees what the price of the\nplot is and how much of that value is the price of the structure. They\nare partners in that. The owner of the plot has as much as his\nportion, and the creditors have the amount of the portion of the\nstructure.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The explanation of that is that the\nvalue of it all is fifteen hundred dirhams. The value of the plot is\nfive hundred dirhams, and the value of the building is one thousand\ndirhams. The owner of the plot has a third, and the creditors have\ntwo-thirds.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"It is like that with spinning and\nother things of the same nature in these circumstances and the buyer\nhas a debt which he cannot pay. This is the behaviour in such cases.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"As for goods which have been sold and which the\nbuyer does not improve, but those goods sell well and have gone up in\nprice, so their owner wants them and the creditors also want to seize\nthem, then the creditors choose between giving the owner of the goods\nthe price for which he sold them and not giving him any loss and\nsurrendering his goods to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"If the price of the goods has\ngone down, the one who sold them has a choice. If he likes, he can\ntake his goods and he has no claim to any of his debtor's property,\nand that is his right. If he likes, he can be one of the creditors and\ntake a portion of his due and not take his goods. That is up to him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said about someone who bought a slave-girl or animal\nand she gave birth in his possession and the buyer went bankrupt, \"The\nslave-girl or the animal and the offspring belong to the seller unless\nthe creditors desire it.
