The well is of no account and no compensation is due for it.\nThe mine is of no account and no compensation is due for it and a\nfifth is due for buried treasures.\" (Al-kanz: see Book 17).\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Everyone leading an animal by the halter, driving it, and\nriding it is responsible for what the animal strikes unless the animal\nkicks out without anything being done to it to make it kick out.

Whatever reaches a third\nor more, is owed by his tribe. Any such things that he does which he\nis permitted to do on the muslims' road are something for which he has\nno liability or loss. Part of that is a hole which a man digs to\ncollect rain, and the beast from which the man alights for some need\nand leaves standing on the road. There is no penalty against anyone\nfor this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who went down a well, and\nanother man followed behind him, and the lower one pulled the higher\none and they fell into the well and both died He said, \"The tribe of\nthe one who pulled him in is responsible for the blood-money.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a child whom a man ordered to go down into a\nwell or to climb a palm tree and he died as a result. He said, \"The\none who ordered him is liable for whatever befalls him, be it death or\nsomething else.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The way of doing things in our\ncommunity about which there is no dispute is that women and children\nare not obliged to pay blood-money together with the tribe in the\nblood-moneys which the tribe must pay. The blood-money is only\nobligatory for a man who has reached puberty.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said\nthat the tribe could bind themselves to the blood-money of mawali if\nthey wished. If they refused, they were people of the diwan or were\ncut off from their people. In the time of the Messenger of Allah, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, people paid the blood-money to\neach other as well as in the time of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq before there\nwas a diwan. The diwan was in the time of Umar ibn al-Khattab. No one\nother than one's people and the ones holding the wala' paid blood-\nmoney for one because the wala' was not transferable and because the\nProphet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"The wala'\nbelongs to the one who sets free.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The wala' is\nan established relationship.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What is done in\nour community about animals that are injured is that the person who\ncauses the injury pays whatever of their value has been diminished.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said about a man condemned to death and one of the\nother hudud befell him, \"He is not punished for it. That is because\nthe killing overrides all of that, except for slander. The slander\nremains hanging over the one to whom it was said because it will be\nsaid to him, 'Why do you not flog the one who slandered you?' I think\nthat the condemned man is flogged with the hadd before he is killed,\nand then he is killed. I do not think that any retaliation is\ninflicted on him for any injury except killing because killing\noverrides all of that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What is done in our\ncommunity is that when a murdered person is found among the main body\nof a people in a village or other place, the house or place of the\nnearest people to him is not responsible. That is because the murdered\nperson can be slain and then cast at the door of some people to shame\nthem by it. No one is responsible for the like of that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said about a group of people who fight with each other and when\nthe fight is broken up, a man is found dead or wounded, and it is not\nknown who did it, \"The best of what is heard about that is that there\nis blood-money for him, and the blood-money is against the people who\nargued with him.

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Marwan ibn\nal-Hakam wrote to Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan to mention to him that a\ndrunkard was brought to him who had killed a man. Muawiya wrote to him\nto kill him in retaliation for the dead man.\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that\nMalik said, \"The best of what I have heard on the interpretation of\nthis ayat, the word of Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, 'The free man\nfor the free man and the slave for the slave - these are men and the\nwoman for the woman,' (Sura 2 ayat 178) is that retaliation is between\nwomen as it is between men. The free woman is killed for the free\nwoman as the free man is killed for the free man. The slave-girl is\nslain for the slave-girl as the slave is slain for the slave.\nRetaliation is between women as it is between men. That is because\nAllah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said in His Book, 'We have written\nfor them in it that it is a life for a life and an eye for an eye, a\nnose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and\nfor wounds there is retaliation.' (Sura 5 ayat 48) Allah, the Blessed,\nthe Exalted, mentioned that it is a life for a life. It is the life of\na free woman for the life of a free man, and her injury for his\ninjury.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said about a man who held a man fast for\nanother man to hit, and he died on the spot, \"If he held him and he\nthought that he meant to kill him, the two of them are both killed for\nhim. If he held him and he thought that he meant to beat him as people\nsometimes do, and he did not think that he meant to kill him, the\nmurderer is slain and the one who held him is punished with a very\nsevere punishment and jailed for a year. There is no killing against\nhim.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said about a man who murdered a man intentionally\nor gouged out his eye intentionally, and then was slain or had his eye\ngouged out himself before retaliation was inflicted on him, \"There is\nno blood-money nor retaliation against him. The right of the one who\nwas killed or had his eye gouged out goes when the thing which he is\nclaiming as retaliation goes. It is the same with a man who murders\nanother man intentionally and then the murderer dies. When the\nmurderer dies, the one seeking blood-revenge has nothing of blood-\nmoney or anything else. That is by the word of Allah, the Blessed the\nExalted, 'Retaliation is written for you in killing. The free man for\nthe free man and the slave for the slave.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"He\nonly has retaliation against the one who killed him. If the man who\nmurdered him dies, he has no retaliation or blood-money.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no retaliation held against a free man by a\nslave for any injury. The slave is killed for the free man when he\nintentionally murders him. The free man is not slain for the slave,\neven if he murders him intentionally. It is the best of what I have\nheard.\"\n</p></b>",

If not, the injury which each of them has\ncaused is a debt against them.

The tribe of the murderer\nis not liable for any of the value of the slave, great or small. That\nis the responsibility of the one who struck him from his own personal\nproperty as far as it covers.

The wound bled profusely and he died. Suraqa ibn\nJusham came to Umar ibn al-Khattab and mentioned that to him Umar said\nto him, \"At the watering place of Qudayd count one hundred and twenty\ncamels and wait until I come to you.\" When Umar ibn al-Khattab came to\nhim, he took thirty four-year-old camels, thirty five-year-old camels,\nand forty pregnant camels from them. Then he said, \"Where is the\nbrother of the slain man?\" He said, \"Here.\" He said, \"Take them. The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,\n'The killer gets nothing.' \"\n</p></b>",
