I said,\n'Messenger of Allah; come to the shade.' So the Messenger of Allah,\nmay Allah bless him and grant him peace, sat down, and I stood up and\nwent to a sack of ours. I looked in it for something and found a small\ncucumber and broke it. Then I brought it to the Messenger of Allah,\nmay Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said, 'From where did you\nget this?' I said, 'We brought it from Madina, Messenger of Allah.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nJabir continued, \"We had a friend of ours with us whom we\nused to equip to go out to guard our mounts. I gave him what was\nnecessary and then he turned about to go to the mounts and he was\nwearing two threadbare cloaks of his. The Messenger of Allah, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, looked at him and said, 'Does he\nhave two garments other than these?' I said, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.\nHe has two garments in the bag.' I gave them to him. He said, 'Let him\ngo and put them on.' I let him go to put them on. As he turned to go,\nthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,\nexclaimed, 'May Allah strike his neck. Isn't that better for him?' He\nsaid (taking him literally), 'Messenger of Allah, in the way of\nAllah.'
