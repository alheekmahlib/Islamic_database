Aslam said to him, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab loves this\ndrink.\" Abdullah ibn Ayyash therefore carried a great drinking bowl\nand brought it to Umar ibn al-Khattab and placed it before him. Umar\nbrought it near to him and then raised his head. Umar said, \"This\ndrink is good,\" so he drank some of it and then passed it to a man on\nhis right. When Abdullah turned to go, Umar ibn al-Khattab called him\nand asked, \"Are you the person who says that Makka is better than\nMadina?\" Abdullah said, \"I said that it was the Haram of Allah, and\nHis place of security, and His House was in it.\" Umar said, \"I am not\nsaying anything about the House of Allah or His Haram.\" Then Umar\nrepeated \"Are you the person who says that Makka is better than\nMadina?\" He replied, \"I said that it was the Haram of Allah and His\nplace of security, and His House was in it.\" Umar said, \"I am not\nsaying anything about the House of Allah and His Haram.\" Then Abdullah\nleft.\n</p></b>",

Umar called out to\nthe people, 'I am leaving by camel in the morning,' so they set out.\nAbu Ubayda said, 'Is it flight from the decree of Allah?' Umar said,\n'Better that someone other than you had said it, Abu Ubayda. Yes. We\nflee from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. What would you\nthink if these camels had gone down into a valley which had two\nslopes, one of them fertile, and the other barren. If you pastured in\nthe fertile part, wouldn't you pasture them by the decree of Allah? If\nyou pastured them in the barren part, wouldn't you pasture them by the\ndecree of Allah?'\n</p>\n<p>\n''Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf arrived and he had\nbeen off doing something and he said, 'I have some knowledge of this.\nI heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\npeace, say, \"If you hear about it in a land, do not go forward to it.\nIf it comes upon a land and you are in it, then do not depart in\nflight from it.\" ' Umar praised Allah and then set off.\"\n</p></b>",
