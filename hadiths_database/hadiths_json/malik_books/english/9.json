Muadh said, \"One day he delayed the prayer, and then came out\nand prayed dhuhr and asr together. Then he said, 'Tomorrow you will\ncome, insha' llah, to the spring of Tabuk. But you will not get there\nuntil well into the morning. No one who arrives should touch any of\nits water until I come.' We came to it and two men had got to it\nbefore us and the spring was dripping with a little water. The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked\nthem, 'Have you touched any of its water?' They said, 'Yes.' The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reviled\nthem and said what Allah wished him to say. Then they took water with\ntheir hands from the spring little by little until it had been\ncollected in something. Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless\nhim and grant him peace, washed his face and hands in it. Then he put\nit back into the spring and the spring flowed with an abundance of\nwater and the people drew water from it. The Messenger of Allah, may\nAllah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If you live long enough,\nMuadh, you will soon see this place filled with gardens.' \"\n</p></b>",
