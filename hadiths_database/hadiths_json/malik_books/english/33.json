        "hadithText": "<p>\nMalik related to me from Ibn Shihab from Sulayman ibn Yasar that\nthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used\nto send Abdullah ibn Rawaha to Khaybar, to assess the division of the\nfruit crop between him and the jews of Khaybar.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe jews\ncollected for Abdullah pieces of their women's jewellery and said to\nhim, \"This is yours. Go light on us and don't be exact in the\ndivision!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAbdullah ibn Rawaha said, \"O tribe of jews! By\nAllah! You are among the most hateful to me of Allah's creation, but\nit does not prompt me to deal unjustly with you. What you have offered\nas a bribe is forbidden. We will not touch it.\" They said, \"This is\nwhat supports the heavens and the earth.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If a\nshare-cropper waters the palms and between them there is some\nuncultivated land, whatever he cultivates in the uncultivated land is\nhis.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If the owner of the land makes a condition\nthat he will cultivate the uncultivated land for himself, that is not\ngood because the sharecropper does the watering for the owner of the\nland and so he increases the owner of the land in property (without\nany return for himself).\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If the owner\nstipulates that the fruit crop is to be shared between them, there is\nno harm in that if all the maintenance of the property - seeding,\nwatering and case, etc. - are the concern of the sharecropper.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the share-cropper stipulates that the seeds are the\nresponsibility of the owner of the property - that is not permitted\nbecause he has stipulated an outlay against the owner of the property.\nShare-cropping is conducted on the basis that all the care and expense\nis outlayed by the share-cropper, and the owner of the property is not\nobliged anything. This is the accepted method of share-cropping.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a spring which was shared between two men, and\nthen the water dried up and one of them wanted to work on the spring\nand the other said, \"I don't have the means to work on it.\" He said,\n\"Tell the one who wants to work on the spring, 'Work and expend. All\nthe water will be yours. You will have its water until your companion\nbrings you half of what you have spent. If he brings you half of what\nyou have spent, he can take his share of the water.' The first one is\ngiven all the water, because he has spent on it, and if he does not\nreach anything by his work, the other has not incurred any expense.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"It is not good for a share-cropper not to expend\nanything but his labour and to be hired for a share of the fruit while\nall the expense and work is incurred by the owner of the garden,\nbecause the share-cropper does not know what the exact wage is going\nto be for his labour, whether it will be little or great.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"No-one who lends a qirad or grants a share-cropping\ncontract, should exempt some of the wealth, or some of the trees from\nhis agent, because, by that, the agent becomes his hired man. He says,\n'I will grant you a share-crop provided that you work for me on such-\nand-such a palm - water it and tend it. I will give you a qirad for\nsuch-and-such money provided that you work for me with ten dinars.\nThey are not part of the qirad I have given you.' That must not be\ndone and it is not good. This is what is done in our community.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The sunna about what is permitted to an owner of a\ngarden in share-cropping is that he can stipulate to the share-cropper\nthe maintenance of walls, cleaning the spring, sweeping the irrigation\ncanals, pollinating the palms, pruning branches, harvesting the fruit\nand such things, provided that the share-cropper has a share of the\nfruit fixed by mutual agreement. However, the owner cannot stipulate\nthe beginning of new work which the agent will start digging a well,\nraising the source of a well, instigating new planting, or building a\ncistern whose cost is great. That is as if the owner of the garden\nsaid to a certain man, 'Build me a house here or dig me a well or make\na spring flow for me or do some work for me for half the fruit of this\ngarden of mine,' before the fruit of the garden is sound and it is\nhalal to sell it. This is the sale of fruit before its good condition\nis clear. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\npeace, forbade fruit to be sold before its good condition became\nclear.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If the fruits are good and their good\ncondition is clear and selling them is halal and then the owner asks a\nman to do one of those jobs for him, specifying the job, for half the\nfruit of his garden, for example, there is no harm in that. He has\nhired the man for something recognised and known. The man has seen it\nand is satisfied with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"As for share-cropping, if the\ngarden has no fruit or little or bad fruit, he has only that. The\nlabourer is only hired for a set amount, and hire is only permitted on\nthese terms. Hire is a type of sale. One man buys another man's work\nfrom him. It is not good if uncertainty enters into it because the\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade\nuncertain transactions.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The sunna in share-\ncropping with us is that it can be practised with any kind of fruit\ntree, palm, vine, olive tree, pomegranate, peach, and soon. It is\npermitted, and there is no harm in it provided that the owner of the\nproperty has a share of the fruit: a half or a third or a quarter or\nwhatever.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Share-cropping is also permitted in\nany crop which emerges from the earth if it is a crop which is picked,\nand its owner cannot water, work on it and tend it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Share-\ncropping becomes reprehensible in anything in which share-cropping is\nnormally permitted if the fruit is sound and the good condition is\nclear and it is halal to sell it. He must share-crop in it the next\nyear. If a man waters fruit whose good condition is clear and it is\nhalal to sell it, and he picks it for the owner, for a share of the\ncrop, it is not sharecropping. It is similar to him being paid in\ndirhams and dinars. Share-cropping is what is between pruning the\npalms and when the fruit becomes sound and its sale is halal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If some one makes a share-cropping contract for fruit\ntrees before the condition becomes clear and its sale is halal, it is\nshare-cropping and is permitted . \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Uncultivated\nland must not be involved in a share-cropping contract. That is\nbecause it is halal for the owner to rent it for dinars and dirhams or\nthe equivalent for an accepted price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"As for a\nman who gives his uncultivated earth for a third or a fourth of what\ncomes out of it, that is an uncertain transaction because crops may be\nscant one time and plentiful another time. It may perish completely\nand the owner of the land will have abandoned a set rent which would\nhave been good for him to rent the land for. He takes an uncertain\nsituation, and does not know whether or not it will be satisfactory.\nThis is disapproved. It is like a man having someone travel for him\nfor a set amount, and then saying, 'Shall I give you a tenth of the\nprofit of the journey as your wage?' This is not halal and must not be\ndone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik summed up,\"A man must not hire out himself or\nhis land or his ship unless for a set amount.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"A\ndistinction is made between sharecropping in palms and in cultivated\nland because the owner of the palms cannot sell the fruit until its\ngood condition is clear. The owner of the land can rent it when it is\nuncultivated with nothing on it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What is done\nin our community about palms is that they can also be share-cropped\nfor three and four years, and less or more than that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"That is what I have heard. Any fruit trees like that are in the\nposition of palms. Contracts for several years are permissible for the\nsharecropper as they are permissible in the palms.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid about the owner, \"He does not take anything additional from the\nshare-cropper in the way of gold or silver or crops which increases\nhim. That is not good. The share-cropper also must not take from the\nowner of the garden anything additional which will increase him of\ngold, silver, crops or anything. Increase beyond what is stipulated in\nthe contract is not good. It is also not good for the lender of a\nqirad to be in this position. If such an increase does enter share-\ncropping or quirad, it becomes by it hire. It is not good when hire\nenters it. Hire must never occur in a situation which has uncertainty\nin it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who gave land to another man\nin a share-cropping contract in which there were palms, vines, or the\nlike of that of fruit trees and there was also uncultivated land in\nit. He said, \"If the uncultivated land is secondary to the fruit\ntrees, either in importance or in size of land, there is no harm in\nshare-cropping. That is if the palms take up two-thirds of the land or\nmore, and the uncultivated land is a third or less. This is because\nwhen the land that the fruit trees take up is secondary to the\nuncultivated land and the cultivated land in which the palms, vines or\nthe like is a third or less, and the uncultivated land is two-thirds\nor more, it is permitted to rent the land and share-cropping in it is\nharam.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"One of the practices of people is to give out\nsharecropping contracts on property with fruit trees when there is\nuncultivated land in it, and to rent land while there are fruit trees\non it, just as a Qur'an or sword which has some embellishment on it of\nsilver is sold for silver, or a necklace or ring which have stones and\ngold in them are sold for dinars. These sales continue to be\npermitted. People buy and sell by them. Nothing described or\ninstituted has come on that which if exceeded, makes it haram, and if\nfallen below makes it halal. What is done in our community about that\nis what people practise and permit among themselves. That is, if the\ngold or silver is secondary to what it is incorporated in, it is\npermitted to sell it. That is, if the value of the blade, the Qur'an,\nor the stones is two-thirds or more, and the value of the decoration\nis one-third or less.\"\n</p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, \"The best of what has been heard\nabout a sharecropper stipulating on the owner of the property the\ninclusion of some slave workers, is that there is no harm in that if\nthey are workers that come with the property. They are like the\nproperty. There is no profit in them for the share-cropper except to\nlighten some of his burden. If they did not come with the property,\nhis toil would be harder. It is like share-cropping land with a spring\nor land with a watering trough. You will not find anyone who receives\nthe same share for share-cropping two lands which are equal in\nproperty and yield, when one property has a constant plentiful spring\nand the other has a watering trough, because of the lightness of\nworking land with a spring, and the hardship of working land with a\nwatering trough.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik added, \"That is what is done in our\ncommunity.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"A share-cropper cannot employ\nworkers from the property in other work, and he cannot make that a\nstipulation with the one who gives him the share-cropping contract.\nNor is it permitted to one who share-crops to stipulate on the owner\nof the property inclusion of slaves for use in the garden who are not\nin it when he makes the share-cropping contract.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Nor must\nthe owner of the property stipulate on the one who uses his property\nfor share-cropping that he take any of the slaves of the property and\nremove him from the property. The share-cropping of property is based\non the state which it is currently in.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"If the owner of the\nproperty wants to remove one of the slaves of the property, he removes\nhim before the share-cropping, or if he wants to put someone into the\nproperty, he does it before the share-cropping. Then he grants the\nshare-cropping contract after that if he wishes. If any of the slaves\ndie or go off or become ill, the owner of the property must replace\nthem.\"\n</p></b>",
