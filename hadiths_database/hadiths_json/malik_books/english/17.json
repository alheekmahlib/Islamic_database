Similarly, there is\nno zakat to pay on (silver) that is clearly less than two hundred\ndirhams (in weight), but if it increases so that by the increase the\namount reaches a full two hundred dirhams in weight then zakat has to\nbe paid. If it passes the full weight then I think there is zakat to\npay, whether it be dinars or dirhams.\" (i.e. the zakat is assessed by\nthe weight and not the number of the coins.)\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\nabout a man who had one hundred and sixty dirhams by weight, and the\nexchange rate in his town was eight dirhams to a dinar, that he did\nnot have to pay any zakat. Zakat had only to be paid on twenty dinars\nof gold or two hundred dirhams.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, in the case of a\nman who acquired five dinars from a transaction or in some other way\nwhich he then invested in trade, that, as soon as it increased to a\nzakatable amount and then a year elapsed, he had to pay zakat on it,\neven if the zakatable amount was reached one day before or one day\nafter the passing of a year. There was then no zakat to pay on it from\nthe day the zakat was taken until a year had elapsed over it.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, in the similar case of a man who had in his possession ten\ndinars which he invested in trade and which reached twenty dinars by\nthe time one year had elapsed over them, that he paid zakat on them\nright then and did not wait until a year had elapsed over them,\n(counting) from the day when they actually reached the zakatable\namount. This was because a year had elapsed over the original dinars\nand there were now twenty of them in his possession. After that there\nwas no zakat to pay on them from the day the zakat was paid until\nanother year had elapsed over them.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What we are\nagreed upon (here in Madina) regarding income from hiring out slaves,\nrent from property, and the sums received when a slave buys his\nfreedom, is that no zakat is due on any of it, whether great or small,\nfrom the day the owner takes possession of it until a year has elapsed\nover it from the day when the owner takes possession of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, in the case of gold and silver which was shared between\ntwo co-owners, that zakat was due from any one whose share reached\ntwenty dinars of gold, or two hundred dirhams of silver, and that no\nzakat was due from anyone whose share fell short of this zakatable\namount. If all the shares reached the zakatable amount and the shares\nwere not equally divided, zakat was taken from each man according to\nthe measure of his share. This applied only when the share of each man\namong them reached the zakatable amount, because the Messenger of\nAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said, \"There is no\nzakat to pay on less than five awaq of silver.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\ncommented, \"This is what I prefer most out of what I have heard about\nthe matter.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"When a man has gold and silver\ndispersed among various people he must add it all up together and then\ntake out the zakat due on the total sum .\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"No\nzakat is due from some one who acquires gold or silver until a year\nhas elapsed over his acquisition from the day it became his.\"\n</p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya related to me from Malik from Yazid ibn Khusayfa that he\nhad asked Sulayman ibn Yasar whether zakat was due from a man who had\nwealth in hand but also owed a debt for the same amount, and he\nreplied, \"No.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The position that we are agreed\nupon concerning a debt is that the lender of it does not pay zakat on\nit until he gets it back. Even if it stays with the borrower for a\nnumber of years before the lender collects it, the lender only has to\npay zakat on it once. If he collects an amount of the debt which is\nnot zakatable, and has other wealth which is zakatable, then what he\nhas collected of the debt is added to the rest of his wealth and he\npays zakat on the total sum.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik continued, \"If he has no\nready money other than that which he has collected from his debt, and\nthat does not reach a zakatable amount, then he does not have to pay\nany zakat. He must, however, keep a record of the amount that he has\ncollected and if, later, he collects another amount which, when added\nto what he has already collected, brings zakat into effect, then he\nhas to pay zakat on it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik continued, \"Zakat is due on\nthis first amount, together with what he has further collected of the\ndebt owed to him, regardless of whether or not he has used up what he\nfirst collected. If what he takes back reaches twenty dinars of gold,\nor two hundred dirhams of silver he pays zakat on it. He pays zakat on\nanything else he takes back afte rthat, whether it be a large or small\namount, according to the amount.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What shows\nthat zakat is only taken once from a debt which is out of hand for\nsome years before it is recovered is that if goods remain with a man\nfor trading purposes for some years before he sells them, he only has\nto pay zakat on their prices once. This is because the one who is owed\nthe debt, or owns the goods, should not have to take the zakat on the\ndebt, or the goods, from anything else, since the zakat on anything is\nonly taken from the thing itself, and not from anything else.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Our position regarding some onewho owes a debt, and\nhas goods which are worth enough to pay off the debt, and also has an\namount of ready money which is zakatable, is that he pays the zakat on\nthe ready money which he has to hand.  If, however, he only has enough\ngoods and ready money to pay off the debt, then he does not have to\npay any zakat. But if the ready money that he has reaches a zakatable\namount over and above the amount of the debt that he owes, then he\nmust pay zakat on it.\"\n</p></b>",

This is therefore not the same as the harvest crops\nthat a man reaps from his land, or the dates that he harvests from his\npalms.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"A man who has wealth which he invests in\ntrade, but which does not realise a zakatable profit for him, fixes a\nmonth in the year when he takes stock of what goods he has for\ntrading, and counts the gold and silver that he has in ready money,\nand if all of it comes to a zakatable amount he pays zakat on it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The position is the same for muslims who trade\nand muslims who do not.

When I meet him, I will ask him.\" But the Messenger of\nAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died before Muadh ibn\nJabal returned.\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, \"The best that I\nhave heard about some one who has sheep or goats with two or more\nshepherds in different places is that they are added together and the\nowner then pays the zakat on them. This is the same situation as a man\nwho has gold and silver scattered in the hands of various people. He\nmust add it all u p and pay whatever zakat there is to pay on the sum\ntotal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, about a man who had both\nsheep and goats, that they were added up together for the zakat to be\nassessed, and if between them they came to a number on which zakat was\ndue, he paid zakat on them. Malik added, \"They are all considered as\nsheep, and in Umar ibn al-Khattab's book it says, 'On grazing sheep\nand goats, if they come to forty or more, one ewe.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"If there are more sheep than goats and their owner only has to\npay one ewe, the zakat collector takes the ewe from the sheep. If\nthere are more goats than sheep, he takes it from the goats. If there\nis an equal number of sheep and goats, he takes the ewe from whichever\nkind he wishes.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, \"Similarly,\nArabian camels and Bactrian camels are added up together in order to\nassess the zakat that the owner has to pay. They are all considered as\ncamels. If there are more Arabian camels than Bactrians and the owner\nonly has to pay one camel, the zakat collector takes it from the\nArabian ones. If, however, there are more Bactrian camels he takes it\nfrom those. If there is an equal number of both, he takes the camel\nfrom whichever kind he wishes.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Similarly, cows\nand water buffaloes are added up together and are all considered as\ncattle. If there are more cows than water buffalo and the owner only\nhas to pay one cow, the zakat collector takes it from the cows. If\nthere are more water buffalo, he takes it from them. If there is an\nequal number of both, he takes the cow from whichever kind he wishes.\nSo if zakat is necessary, it is assessed taking both kinds as one\ngroup.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, \"No zakat is due from\nanyone who comes into possession of livestock, whether camels or\ncattle or sheep and goats, until a year has elapsed over them from the\nday he acquired them, unless he already had in his possession a nisab\nof livestock. (The nisab is the minimum amount on which zakat has to\nbe paid, either five head of camels, or thirty cattle, or forty sheep\nand goats). If he already had five head of camels, or thirty cattle,\nor forty sheep and goats, and he then acquired additional camels, or\ncattle, or sheep and goats, either by trade, or gift, or inheritance,\nhe must pay zakat on them when he pays the zakat on the livestock he\nalready has, even if a year has not elapsed over the acquisition. And\neven if the additional livestock that he acquired has had zakat taken\nfrom it the day before he bought it, or the day before he inherited\nit, he must still pay the zakat on it when he pays the zakat on the\nlivestock he already has \"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, \"This\nis the same situation as some one who has some silver on which he pays\nthe zakat and then uses to buy some goods with from somebody else. He\nthen has to pay zakat on those goods when he sells them. It could be\nthat one man will have to pay zakat on them one day, and by the\nfollowing day the other man will also have to pay.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, in the case of a man who had sheep and goats which did not reach\nthe zakatable amount, and who then bought or inherited an additional\nnumber of sheep and goats well above the zakatable amount, that he did\nnot have to pay zakat on all his sheep and goats until a year had\nelapsed over them from the day he acquired the new animals, whether he\nbought them or inherited them.This was because none of the livestock\nthat a man had, whether it be camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats,\nwas counted as a nisab until there was enough of any one kind for him\nto have to pay zakat on it. This was the nisab which is used for\nassessing the zakat on what the owner had additionally acquired,\nwhether it were a large or small amount of livestock.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"If a man has enough camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats, for\nhim to have to pay zakat on each kind, and then he acquires another\ncamel, or cow, or sheep, or goat, it must be included with the rest of\nhis animals when he pays zakat on them \"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that\nMalik said, \"This is what I like most out of what I heard about the\nmatter.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, in the case of a man who does not have\nthe animal required of him for the zakat, \"If it is a two-year-old\nshe-camel that he does not have, a three-year-old male camel is taken\ninstead. If it is a three- or four- or five-year-old she-camel that he\ndoes not have, then he must buy the required animal so that he gives\nthe collector what is due. I do not like it if the owner gives the\ncollector the equivalent value.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, about camels\nused for carrying water, and cattle used for working water-wheels or\nploughing, \"In my opinion such animals are included when assessing\nzakat.\"\n</p></b>",

If both of them have a\nzakatable amount (of livestock) then both of them are assessed\ntogether (i.e the flock is assessed as one) and both of them have to\npay zakat. If one of them has a thousand sheep, or less, that he has\nto pay zakat on, and the other has forty, or more, then they are\nassociates, and each one pays his contribution according to the number\nof animals he has - so much from the one with a thousand, and so much\nfrom the one with forty.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Two associates in\ncamels are the same as two associates in sheep and goats, and, for the\npurposes of zakat, are assessed together if each one of them has a\nzakatable amount (of camels). That is because the Messenger of Allah,\nmay Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'There is no zakat on\nless than five head of camels,' and Umar ibn al-Khattab said, 'On\ngrazing sheep and goats, if they come to forty or more - one ewe.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik said, \"This is what I like most out of\nwhat I have heard about the matter.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that when\nUmar ibn al-Khattab said, \"Those separated should not be gathered\ntogether nor should those gathered together be separated in order to\navoid paying zakat,\" what he meant was the owners of livestock.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What he meant when he said, 'Those separated should\nnot be gathered together' is, for instance, that there is a group of\nthree men, each of whom has forty sheep and goats, and each of whom\nthus has to pay zakat. Then, when the zakat collector is on his way\n,they gather their flocks together so that they only owe one ewe\nbetween them. This they are forbidden to do.

He\nused to include sakhlas (when assessing zakat), and they said, \"Do you\ninclude sakhlas even though you do not take them (as payment)?\"  He\nreturned to Umar ibn al-Khattab and mentioned that to him and Umar\nsaid, \"Yes, you include a sakhla which the shepherd is carrying, but\nyou do not take it. Neither do you take an akula, or a rubba, or a\nmakhid, or male sheep and goats in their second and third years, and\nthis is a just compromise between the young of sheep and goats and the\nbest of them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"A sakhla is a newborn lamb or\nkid. A rubba is a mother that is looking after her offspring, a makhid\nis a pregnant ewe or goat, and an akula is a sheep or goat that is\nbeing fattened for meat.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, about a man who had\nsheep and goats on which he did not have to pay any zakat, but which\nincreased by birth to a zakatable amount on the day before the zakat\ncollector came to them, \"If the number of sheep and goats along with\ntheir (newborn) offspring reaches a zakatable amount then the man has\nto pay zakat on them. That is because the offspring of the sheep are\npart of the flock itself. It is not the same situation as when some\none acquires sheep by buying them, or is given them, or inherits them.\nRather, it is like when merchandise whose value does not come to a\nzakatable amount is sold, and with the profit that accrues it then\ncomes to a zakatable amount. The owner must then pay zakat on both his\nprofit and his original capital, taken together. If his profit had\nbeen a chance acquisition or an inheritance he would not have had to\npay zakat on it until one year had elapsed over it from the day he had\nacquired it or inherited it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The young of sheep\nand goats are part of the flock, in the same way that profit from\nwealth is part of that wealth. There is, however, one difference, in\nthat when a man has a zakatable amount of gold and silver, and then\nacquires an additional amount of wealth, he leaves aside the wealth he\nhas acquired and does not pay zakat on it when he pays the zakat on\nhis original wealth but waits until a year has elapsed over what he\nhas acquired from the day he acquired it. Whereas a man who has a\nzakatable amount of sheep and goats, or cattle, or camels, and then\nacquires another camel, cow, sheep or goat, pays zakat on it at the\nsame time that he pays the zakat on the others of its kind, if he\nalready has a zakatable amount of livestock of that particular kind.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"This is the best of what I have heard about\nthis. \"\n</p></b>",

His livestock may have died or it\nmay have increased, and the zakat collector only assesses the zakat on\nwhat he (actually) finds on the day he makes the assessment. If more\nthan one payment of zakat is due from the owner of the livestock, he\nstill only has to pay zakat according to what the zakat collector\n(actually) finds in his possession, and if his livestock has died, or\nseveral payments of zakat are due from him and nothing is taken until\nall his livestock has died, or has been reduced to an amount below\nthat on which he has to pay zakat, then he does not have to pay any\nzakat, and there is no liability (on him) for what has died or for the\nyears that have passed.\n</p></b>",

Rather, zakat should be taken from average quality\nproperty.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The position that we are agreed upon\nconcerning fruit is that only dates and grapes are estimated while on\nthe tree. They are estimated when their usability is clear and they\nare halal to sell.

'lf any of\nthe categories comes to five awsuq, then zakat must be paid. If none\nof the categories comes to five awsuq, then there is no zakat to pay.\nThe explanation of this is that when a man harvests five awsuq of\ndates (from his palms), he adds them all together and deducts the\nzakat from them even if they are all of different kinds and varieties.\nIt is the same with different kinds of cereal, such as brown wheat,\nwhite wheat, barley and sult, which are all considered as one\ncategory. If a man reaps five awsuq of any of these, he adds it all\ntogether and pays zakat on it. If it does not come to that amount he\ndoes not have to pay any zakat. It is the same (also) with grapes,\nwhether they be black or red. If a man picks five awsuq of them he has\nto pay zakat on them, but if they do not come to that amount he does\nnot have to pay any zakat. Pulses also are considered as one category,\nlike cereals, dates and grapes, even if they are of different\nvarieties and are called by different names. Pulses include chick-\npeas, lentils, beans, peas, and anything which is agreed by everybody\nto be a pulse. If a man harvests five awsuq of pulses, measuring by\nthe aforementioned sa, the sa of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and\ngrant him peace, he collects them all together and must pay zakat on\nthem, even if they are of every kind of pulse and not just one kind.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab drew a distinction between\npulses and wheat when he took zakat from the Nabatean christians. He\nconsidered all pulses to be one category and took a tenth from them,\nand from cereals and raisins he took a twentieth.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"If some one asks, 'How can pulses be added up all together when\nassessing the zakat so that there is just one payment, when a man can\nbarter two of one kind for one of another, while cereals can not be\nbartered at a rate of two to one?', then tell him, 'Gold and silver\nare collected together when assessing the zakat, even though an amount\nof gold dinars can be exchanged for many times tha tamount of silver\ndirhams.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, regarding date palms which are shared\nequally between two men, and from which eight awsuq of dates are\nharvested, \"They do not have to pay any zakat on them. If one man owns\nfive awsuq of what is harvested from one piece of land, and the other\nowns four awsuq or less, the one who owns the five awsuq has to pay\nzakat, and the other one, who harvested four awsuq or less, does not\nhave to pay zakat. This is how things are done whenever there are\nassociates in any crop, whether the crop is grain or seeds that are\nreaped, or dates that are harvested, or grapes that are picked . Any\none of them that harvests five awsuq of dates, or picks five awsuq of\ngrapes, or reaps five awsuq of wheat, has to pay zakat, and whoever's\nportion is less than five awsuq does not have to pay zakat. Zakat only\nhas to be paid by someone whose harvesting or picking or reaping comes\nto five awsuq.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The sunna with us regarding\nanything from any of these categories, i.e. wheat, dates, grapes and\nany kind of grain o rseed, which has had the zakat deducted from it\nand is then stored by its owner for a number of years after he has\npaid the zakat on it until he sell sit, is that he does not have to\npay any zakat on the price he sells it for until a year has elapsed\nover it from the day he made the sale, as long as he got it through\n(chance) acquisition or some other means and it was not intended for\ntrading. Cereals, seeds and trade-goods are the same, in that if a man\nacquires some and keeps them for a number of years and then sells them\nfor gold or silver, he does not have to pay zakat on their price until\na year has elapsed over it from the day of sale. If, however, the\ngoods were intended for trade then the owner must pay zakat on them\nwhen he sells them, as long as he has had them for a year from the day\nwhen he paid zakat on the property with which he bought them.\"\n</p></b>",

The people of dhimma and the magians do not\nhave to pay any zakat on their palms or their vines or their crops or\ntheir livestock. This is because zakat is imposed on the muslims to\npurify them and to be given back to their poor, whereas jizya is\nimposed on the people of the Book to humble them. As long as they are\nin the country they have agreed to live in, they do not have to pay\nanything on their property except the jizya. If, however, they trade\nin muslim countries, coming and going in them, a tenth is taken from\nwhat they invest in such trade. This is because jizya is only imposed\non them on conditions, which they have agreed on, namely that they\nwill remain in their own countries, and that war will be waged for\nthem on any enemy of theirs, and that if they then leave that land to\ngo anywhere else to do business they will haveto pay a tenth. Whoever\namong them does business with the people of Egypt, and then goes to\nSyria, and then does business with the people of Syria and then goes\nto Iraq and does business with them and then goes on to Madina, or\nYemen, or other similar places, has to pay a tenth.\n</p>\n<p>\nPeople of\nthe Book and magians do not have to pay any zakat on any of their\nproperty, livestock, produce or crops. The sunna still continues like\nthat. They remain in the deen they were in, and they continue to do\nwhat they used to do. If in any one year they frequently come and go\nin muslim countries then they have to pay a tenth every time they do\nso, since that is outside what they have agreed upon, and not one of\nthe conditions stipulated for them.
