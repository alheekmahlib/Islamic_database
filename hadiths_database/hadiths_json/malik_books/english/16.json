Nothing will satisfy me except what he says about it.'\nEveryone went away, but she stuck to his door and said, 'I must see\nhim.' Someone said to him, 'There is a woman who wishes to ask your\nopinion about something,' and she insisted, 'I will only talk to him\nabout it.'  When everyone had gone away, and she still had not left\nhis door, he said, 'Let her in.' So she went in and saw him and said,\n'I have come to ask your opinion about something.'  He said, 'What is\nit?' She said, 'I borrowed a piece of jewellery from a neighbour of\nmine, and I have worn it and used it for a long time. Then they sent\nto me for it. Should I let them have it back?'  He said, 'Yes, by\nAllah.' She said, 'I have had it for a long time.'  He said, 'It is\nmore correct for you to return it to them, since they have lent it to\nyou for such a long time.'  She said, 'Yes. May Allah have mercy on\nyou. Do you then grieve over what Allah has lent you and then taken\nfrom you, when He has a greater right to it than you?'
