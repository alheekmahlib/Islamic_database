If they could not be eaten until\nthe people had gathered for the division and the spoils had been\ndistributed among them, that would be harmful for the army. I do not\nsee any objection to eating such things within acceptable limits. I do\nnot think, however, that anyone should store up any of it to take back\nto his family.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik was asked whether it was proper for a\nman who obtained food in enemy territory and ate some of it and made\nprovision so that there was some of it left over to keep and eat with\nhis family, or to sell before he had come to his country and make use\nof its price. He said, \"If he sells it while he is on a military\nexpedition, I think that he should put its price into the booty of the\nMuslims. If he takes it back to his country, I see no objection to his\neating it and using it if it is a small insignificant thing.\"\n</p></b>",

Then the Muslims recaptured them,\nand they were returned to Abdullah ibn Umar, before the division of\nthe spoils took place.\n</p>\n<p>\nI heard Malik say about muslim\nproperty that had been seized by the enemy, \"If it is noticed before\nthe distribution, then it is returned to itsowner. Whatever has\nalready been distributed is not returned to anyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik,\nwhen asked about a man whose young male slave was taken by the idol\nworshippers and then the Muslims re-captured him, said, \"The owner is\nmore entitled to him without having to pay his price or value or\nhaving to incur any loss before the distribution takes place. If the\ndistribution has already taken place then I think that the slave\nbelongs to his master for his price if the master wants him back.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRegarding an umm walad of a Muslim man who has been taken by\nthe idol worshippers and then recaptured by the Muslims and allotted\nin the distribution of spoils and then recognised by her master after\nthe distribution, Malik said, \"She is not to be enslaved. I think that\nthe Imam should pay a  ransom for her for her master. If  he does not\ndo it, then her master must pay a ransom for her and not leave her. I\ndo not think that she should be made a slave by whoever takes her and\nintercourse with her is not halal. She is in the position of a free\nwoman because her master would be required to pay compensation if she\ninjured somebody and so she is in the same position (as a wife). He\nmust not leave the mother of his son to be enslaved nor may\nintercourse with her be made halal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik was asked about a\nman who went to enemy territory to pay ransom or to trade, and he\nbought a free man or a slave, or they were given to him. He said, \"As\nfor the free man, the price he buys him for is a debt against the man\nand he is not made a slave. If the captive is given to him freely, he\nis free and owes nothing unless the man gave something in recompense\nfor him. That is a debt against the free man, the same as if a ransom\nhad been paid for him. As for a slave, his former master can choose to\ntake him back and pay his price to the man who bought him or he can\nchoose to leave him, as he wishes. If he was given to the man, the\nformer master is more entitled to him, and he owes nothing for him\nunless the man gave something for him in recompense. Whatever he gave\nfor him is a loss against the master if he wants him back.\"\n</p></b>",
