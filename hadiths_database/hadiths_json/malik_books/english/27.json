If there are only females, and there are more than two, they\nget two thirds of what is left between them. If there is only one, she\ngets a half. If someone shares with the children, who has a fixed\nshare and there are males among them, the reckoner begins with the\nones with fixed shares. What remains after that is divided among the\nchildren according to their inheritance.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"When there are no\nchildren, grandchildren through sons have the same position as\nchildren, so that grandsons are like sons and grand-daughters are like\ndaughters. They inherit as they inherit and they overshadow as they\novershadow. If there are both children and grandchildren through sons,\nand there is a male among the children, then the grandchildren through\nsons do not share in the inheritance with him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"If there is\nno surviving male among the children, and there are two or more\ndaughters, the granddaughters through a son do not share in the\ninheritance with them unless there is a male who is in the same\nposition as them in relation to the deceased, or further than them.\nHis presence gives access to whatever is left over, if any, to whoever\nis in his position and whoever is above him of the granddaughters\nthrough sons. If something is left over, they divide it among them,\nand the male takes the portion of two females. If nothing is left\nover, they have nothing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"If the only descendant is a\ndaughter, she takes half, and if there are one or more grand-daughters\nthrough a son who are in the same position to the deceased, they share\na sixth. If there is a male in the same position as the granddaughters\nthrough a son in relation to the deceased, they have no share and no\nsixth .\n</p>\n<p>\n\"If there is a surplus after the allotting of shares\nto the people with fixed shares, the surplus goes to the male and\nwhoever is in his position and whoever is above him of the female\ndescendants through sons. The male has the share of two females. The\none who is more distant in relationship than grandchildren through\nsons has nothing. If there is no surplus, they have nothing. That is\nbecause Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said in His Book, 'Allah\ncharges you about your children that the male has the like of the\nportion of two females. If there are more than two women they have two\nthirds of what is left. If there is one, she has a half.' (Sura 4 ayat\n10)\n</p></b>",

Malik said,\n\"The generally agreed on way of doing things among us and what I have\nseen the people of knowledge in our city doing is that the paternal\ngrandfather does not inherit anything at all with the father. He is\ngiven a sixth as a fixed share with the son and the grandson through a\nson. Other than that, when the deceased does not leave a mother or a\npaternal aunt, one begins with whoever has a fixed share, and they are\ngiven their shares. If there is a sixth of the property left over, the\ngrandfather is given a sixth as a fixed share.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"When someone shares with the grandfather and the full siblings in a\nspecified share, one begins with whoever shares with them of the\npeople of fixed shares. They are given their shares. What is left over\nafter that belongs to the grandfather and the full siblings. Then one\nsees which is the more favourable of two alternatives for the portion\nof the grandfather. Either a third is allotted to him and the siblings\nto divide between them, and he gets a share as if he were one of the\nsiblings, or else he takes a sixth from all the capital. Whichever is\nthe best portion for the grandfather is given to him. What is left\nafter that, goes to the full siblings. The male gets the portion of\ntwo females except in one particular case. The division in this case\nis different from the preceding one. This case is when a woman dies\nand leaves a husband, mother, full sister and grandfather. The husband\ngets a half, the mother gets a third, the grandfather gets a sixth,\nand the full sister gets a half. The sixth of the grandfather and the\nhalf of the sister are joined and divided into thirds. The male gets\nthe share of two females. Therefore, the grandfather has two thirds,\nand the sister has one third.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The inheritance\nof the half-siblings by the father with the grandfather when there are\nno full siblings with them, is like the inheritance of the full\nsiblings (in the same situation). The males are the same as their\nmales and the females are the same as their females. When there are\nboth full siblings and half-siblings by the father, the full siblings\ninclude in their number the number of half-siblings by the father, to\nlimit the inheritance of the grandfather, i.e., if there was only one\nfull sibling with the grandfather. They would share, after the\nallotting of the fixed shares, the remainder of the inheritance\nbetween them equally. If there were also two half-siblings by the\nfather, their number is added to the division of the sum, which would\nthen be divided four ways. A quarter going to the grandfather and\nthree-quarters going to the full siblings who annex the shares\ntechnically allotted to the half-siblings by the father. They do not\ninclude the number of half-siblings by the mother, because if there\nwere only half-siblings by the father they would not inherit anything\nwith the grandfather and all the capital would belong to the\ngrandfather, and so the siblings would not get anything after the\nportion of the grandfather.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It belongs to the full siblings\nmore than the half-siblings by the father, and the half-siblings by\nthe father do not get anything with them unless the full siblings\nconsist of one sister. If there is one full sister, she includes the\ngrandfather with the half-siblings by her father in the division,\nhowever many. Whatever remains for her and these half-siblings by the\nfather goes to her rather than them until she has had her complete\nshare, which is half of the total capital. If there is surplus beyond\nhalf of all the capital in what she and the half-siblings by the\nfather acquire it goes to them. The male has the portion of two\nfemales.

If the paternal grandmother is nearer, or they\nare in the same position in relation to the deceased, the sixth is\ndivided equally between them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"None of the\nfemale grand-relations except for these two has any inheritance\nbecause I have heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him\nand grant him peace, gave the grandmother inheritance, and then Abu\nBakr asked about that until someone reliable related from the\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that he\nhad made the grandmother an heir and given a share to her. Another\ngrandmother came to Umar ibn al-Khattab, and he said, 'I am not one to\nadd to fixed shares. If there are two of you together, it is between\nyou. If either of you is left alone with it, it is hers.' \" Malik\nsaid, \"We do not know of anyone who made other than the two\ngrandmothers heirs from the beginning of Islam to this day.\"\n</p></b>",

As for the kind described in the ayat which was sent down at\nthe beginning of the Surat an-Nisa in which Allah, the Blessed, the\nExalted! said, 'If a man or a woman has no direct heir, but has a\nbrother or a sister by the mother, each of the two has a sixth. If\nthere are more than that, they share equally in a third.' (Sura 4 ayat\n12) This heirless one does not have heirs among his mother's siblings\nsince there are no children or parents. As for the other kind\ndescribed in the ayat which comes at the end of the Surat an-Nisa,\nAllah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said in it, 'They will ask you for a\ndecision. Say, \"Allah gives you a decision about the indirect heirs.\nIf a man perishes having no children, but he has a sister, she shall\nreceive a half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no\nchildren. If there are two sisters, they shall receive two-thirds of\nwhat he leaves. If there are brothers and sisters, the male shall\nreceive the portion of two females. Allah makes clear to you that you\nmight not go astray. Allah has knowledge of everything\" ' \" (Sura 4\nayat 176).\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If this person without direct heirs\n(parents) or children has siblings by the father, they inherit with\nthe grandfather from the person without direct heirs. The grandfather\ninherits with the siblings because he is more entitled to the\ninheritance than them. That is because he inherits a sixth with the\nmale children of the deceased when the siblings do not inherit\nanything with the male children of the deceased. How can he not be\nlike one of them when he takes a sixth with the children of the\ndeceased? How can he not take a third with the siblings while the\nbrother's sons take a third with them? The grandfather is the one who\novershadows the half-siblings by the mother and keeps them from\ninheriting. He is more entitled to what they have because they are\nomitted for his sake. If the grandfather did not take that third, the\nhalf-siblings by the mother would take it and would take what does not\nreturn to the half-siblings by the father. The half-siblings by the\nmother are more entitled to that third than the half-siblings by the\nfather while the grandfather is more entitled to that than the half-\nsiblings by the mother.\"\n</p></b>",
