You never spend\nanything on maintenance desiring the Face of Allah by it, but that you\nare rewarded for it, even what you appoint for your wife.'

If some of them permit him and others refuse,\nhe is allowed to diminish the share of those who have given their\npermission.

Malik said, \"They cannot revoke that.\nHad they been permitted to do so, every heir would have done that, and\nthen, when the testator died, they would take that for themselves and\nprevent him from bequeathing his third and what was permitted to him\nwith respect to his property.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If he asks\npermission of his heirs to grant a bequest to an heir while he is well\nand they give him permission, that is not binding on them. The heirs\ncan rescind that if they wish. That is because when a man is well, he\nis entitled to all his property and can do what he wishes with it. If\nhe wishes, he can spend all of it. He can spend it and give sadaqa\nwith it or give it to whomever he likes. His asking permission of his\nheirs is permitted for the heirs, when they give him permission when\nauthority over all his property is closed off from him and nothing\noutside of the third is permitted to him, and when they are more\nentitled to the two-thirds of his property than he is himself. That is\nwhen their permission becomes relevant. If he asks one of the heirs to\ngive his inheritance to him when he is dying, and the heir agrees and\nthen the dying man does not dispose of it at all, it is returned to\nthe one who gave it unless the deceased said to him, 'So-and-so - (one\nof his heirs) - is weak, and I would like you to give him your\ninheritance.' So he gives it to him. That is permitted when the\ndeceased specified it for him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"When a man gives\nthe dying man free use of his share of the inheritance, and the dying\nman distributes some of it and some remains, it is returned to the\ngiver, after the man has died.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that he heard\nMalik speak about someone who made a bequest and mentioned that he had\ngiven one of his heirs something which he had not taken possession of,\nso the heirs refused to permit that. Malik said, \"That gift returns to\nthe heirs as inheritance according to the Book of Allah because the\ndeceased did not mean that to be taken out of the third and the heirs\ndo not have a portion in the third (which the dying man is allowed to\nbequeath).\"\n</p></b>",

That is because the man is\nliable for them from the day he took them and whatever loss is in them\nafter that is against him. For that reason, their increase and growth\nare also his. A man may take the goods at a time when they are selling\nwell and are in demand, and then have to return them at a time when\nthey have fallen in price and no one wants them. For instance, the man\nmay take the goods from the other man, and sell them for ten dinars or\nkeep them while their price is that. Then he may have to return them\nwhile their price is only a dinar.
