This is what Malik preferred of what he had heard on\nthe subject.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that if a man made a vow to abstain\nfrom intercourse with his wife and then divorced her, and the four\nmonths of the vow were completed before completion of the idda of the\ndivorce, it counted as two pronouncements of divorce. If he declared\nhis intention to continue to abstain and the idda of the divorce\nfinished before the four months the vow of abstention was not a\ndivorce. That was because the four months had passed and she was not\nhis on that day.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If someone makes a vow not to\nhave intercourse with his wife for a day or a month and then waits\nuntil more than four months have passed, it is not ila. Ila only\napplies to someone who vows more than four months. As for the one who\nvows not to have intercourse with his wife for four months or less\nthan that, I do not think that it is ila because when the term enters\ninto it at which it stops, he comes out of his oath and he does not\nhave to declare his intention.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If someone vows\nto his wife not to have intercourse with her until her child has been\nweaned, that is not ila. I have heard that Ali ibn Abi Talib was asked\nabout that and he did not think that it was ila.\"\n</p></b>",

The\nMessenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, separated\nthem and gave the child to the woman.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Allah the\nBlessed, the Exalted, said, 'The testimony of men who accuse their\nwives but do not have any witnesses except themselves is to testify by\nAllah four times that he is being truthful, and a fifth time, that the\ncurse of Allah will be upon him, if he should be a liar. She will\navoid punishment if she testifies by Allah four times that he is a\nliar, and a fifth time, that the wrath of Allah shall be upon her, if\nhe should be telling the truth. ' \"(Sura 24 ayat 6).\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"The sunna with us is that those who curse each other are never\nto be remarried. If the man calls himself a liar, (i.e. takes back his\naccusation), he is flogged with the hadd-punishment, and the child is\ngiven to him, and his wife can never return to him. There is no doubt\nor dispute about this sunna among us. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"If a man\nseparates from his wife by an irrevocable divorce by which he cannot\nreturn to her, and then he denies the paternity of the child she is\ncarrying, whilst she claims that he is the father, and it is possible\nby the timing, that he be so, he must curse her, and the child is not\nrecognised as his.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"That is what is done among\nus, and it is what I have heard from the people of knowledge.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that a man who accused his wife after he had divorced\nher trebly while she was pregnant, and he had at first accepted being\nthe father but then claimed that he had seen her committing adultery\nbefore he separated from her, was flogged with the hadd-punishment,\nand did not curse her.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf he denied the paternity of her\nchild after he had divorced her trebly, and he had not previously\naccepted it, then he cursed her.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"This is what I\nhave heard.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The slave is in the same position\nas the free man as regards making accusations and invoking mutual\ncurses (lian). He acts in the lian as the free man acts although there\nis no hadd applied for slandering a female-slave.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"The muslim slave-girl and the christian and jewish free woman\nalso do lian when a free muslim marries one of them and has\nintercourse with her. That is because Allah - may He be blessed and\nExalted, said in His Book, 'As for those who accuse their wives,' and\nthey are their wives. This is what is done among us.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid that a man who did the lian with his wife, and then stopped and\ncalled himself a liar after one or two oaths and he had not cursed\nhimself in the fifth one, had to be flogged with the hadd-punishment,\nbut they did not have to be separated.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that if a\nman divorced his wife and then after three months the woman said, \"I\nam pregnant,\" and he denied paternity, then he had to do lian.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that the husband of a female slave who pronounced the\nlian on her and then bought her, was not to have intercourse with her,\neven if he owned her. The sunna which had been handed down about a\ncouple who mutually cursed each other in the lian was that they were\nnever to return to each other.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that when a man\npronounced the lian against his wife before he had consummated the\nmarriage, she only had half of the bride price.\n</p></b>",

If she has not had a period in them, she has an\nidda of three months. If she has a period before the end of the three\nmonths, she accepts the period. If another nine months pass without\nher having a period, she does an idda of three months. If she has a\nsecond period before the end of those three months, she accepts the\nperiod. If nine months then pass without a period, she does an idda of\nthree months. If she has a third period, the idda of the period is\ncomplete. If she does not have a period, she waits three months, and\nthen she is free to marry. Her husband can return to her before she\nbecomes free to marry unless he made her divorce irrevocable.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The sunna with us is that when a man divorces his\nwife and has the option to return to her, and she does part of her\nidda and then he returns to her and then parts from her before he has\nhad intercourse with her, she does not add to what has passed of her\nidda. Her husband has wronged himself and erred if he returned to her\nand had no need of her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What is done among us\nis that if a woman becomes a muslim while her husband is a kafir and\nthen he becomes muslim, he is entitled to her as long as she is in her\nidda.
