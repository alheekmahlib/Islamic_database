        "hadithText": "<p>\nMalik related to me that he heard the like of that from Sulayman\nibn Yasar.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who bought out one of the\npartners in a shared property, by paying the man with an animal, a\nslave, a slave-girl, or the equivalent of that in goods. Then another\npartner decided to exercise his right of pre-emption after that, and\nhe found that the slave or slave-girl had died, and no one knew what\nher value had been. The buyer claimed, \"The value of the slave or\nslave-girl was 100 dinars.\" The partner with the right of pre-emption\nclaimed, \"The value was 50 dinars.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"The buyer\ntakes an oath that the value of what he payed was 100 dinars. Then if\nthe one with the right of pre-emption wishes, he can compensate him,\nor else he can leave it, unless he can bring a clear proof that the\nslave or slave-girl's value is less than what the buyer said. If\nsomeone gives away his portion of a shared house or land and the\nrecipient repays him for it by cash or goods, the partners can take it\nby pre-emption if they wish and pay off the recipient the value of\nwhat he gave in dinars or dirhams. If someone makes a gift of his\nportion of a shared house or land, and does not take any remuneration\nand does not seek to, and a partner wants to take it for its value, he\ncannot do so as long as the original partner has not been given\nrecompense for it. If there is any recompense, the one with the right\nof pre-emption can have it for the price of the recompense.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who bought into a piece of shared land for a\nprice on credit, and one of the partners wanted to possess it by right\nof pre-emption . Malik said, \"If it seems likely that the partner can\nmeet the terms, he has right of pre-emption for the same credit terms.\nIf it is feared that he will not be able to meet the terms, but he can\nbring a wealthy and reliable guarantor of equal standing to the one\nwho bought into the land, he can also take possession.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik\nsaid, \"A person's absence does not sever his right of pre-emption.\nEven if he is a way for a long time, there is no time limit after\nwhich the right of preemption is cut off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that if\na man left land to a number of his children, then one of them who had\na child died and the child of the deceased sold his right in that\nland, the brother of the seller was more entitled to pre-empt him than\nhis paternal uncles, the partners of his father.\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"This is what is done in our community.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Pre-\nemption is shared between partners according to their existing shares.\nEach of them takes according to his portion. If it is small, he has\nlittle. If it is great, it is according to that. That is if they are\ntenacious and contend with each other about it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"As for a man who buys out the share of one of his partners, and one\nof the other partners says, 'I will take a portion according to my\nshare,' and the first partner says, 'If you wish to take all the\npreemption, I will give it up to you. If you wish to leave it, then\nleave it.' If the first partner gives him the choice and hands it over\nto him, the second partner can only take all the pre-emption or give\nit back. If he takes it, he is entitled to it. If not, he has\nnothing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who bought land, and\ndeveloped it by planting trees or digging a well etc., and then\nsomeone came, and seeing that he had a right in the land, wanted to\ntake possession of it by pre-emption. Malik said \"He has no right of\npreemption unless he compensates the other for his expenditure. If he\ngives him the price of what he has developed, he is entitled to pre-\nemption . If not, he has no right in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said that\nsomeone who sold off his portion of a shared house or land and then,\non learning that some one with a right of pre-emption was to take\npossession by that right, asked the buyer to revoke the sale, and he\ndid so, did not have the right to do that. The pre-emptor has more\nright to the property for the price for which he sold it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn\nthe case of some one who bought along with a section of a shared house\nor land, an animal and goods (that were not shared), so that when any\none demanded his right of pre-emption in the house or land he said,\n\"Take what I have bought altogether, for I bought it altogether,\"\nMalik said, \"The pre-emptor need only take possession of the house or\nland. Each thing the man bought is assessed according to its share of\nthe lump sum the man paid. Then the pre-emptor takes possession of his\nright for a price which is appropriate on that basis. He does not take\nany animals or goods unless he wants to do that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"If someone sells a section of shared land, and one of those who have\nthe right of preemption surrenders it to the buyer and another refuses\nto do other than take his pre-emption, the one who refuses to\nsurrender has to take all the preemption, and he cannot take according\nto his right and leave what remains.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the case where one of\na number of partners in one house sold his share when all his partners\nwere away except for one man, the one present was given the choice of\neither taking the pre-emption or leaving it, and he said, 'I will take\nmy portion and leave the portions of my partners until they are\npresent. If they take it, that is that. If they leave it, I will take\nall the pre-emption,' Malik said, 'He can only take it all or leave\nit. If his partners come, they can take from him or leave it as they\nwish. If this is offered to him and he does not accept, I think that\nhe has no pre-emption.' \"\n</p></b>",

        "hadithText": "<p>\nYahya said that Malik related from Muhammad ibn Umara from Abu\nBakr ibn Hazm that Uthman ibn Affan said, \"When boundaries are fixed\nin land, there is no pre-emption in it. There is no pre-emption in a\nwell or in male palm trees. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"This is what is\ndone in our community.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no pre-emption\nin a road, whether or not it is practical to divide it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"What is done in our community is that there is no pre-\nemption in the courtyard of a house, whether or not it is practical to\ndivide it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who bought into a shared\nproperty provided that he had the option of withdrawal and the\npartners of the seller wanted to take what their partner was selling\nby pre-emption before the buyer had exercised his option. Malik said,\n\"They cannot do that until the buyer has taken possession and the sale\nis confirmed for him. When the sale is confirmed, they have the right\nof pre-emption.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik spoke about a man who bought land and\nit remained in his hands for some time. Then a man came and saw that\nhe had a share of the land by inheritance. Malik said, \"If the man's\nright of inheritance is established, he also has a right of\npreemption. If the land has produced a crop, the crop belongs to the\nbuyer until the day when the right of the other is established,\nbecause he has tended what was planted against being destroyed or\nbeing carried away by a flood.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik continued, \"If the time\nhas been long, or the witnesses are dead or the seller has died, or\nthe buyer has died, or they are both alive and the basis of the sale\nand purchase has been forgotten because of the length of time, pre-\nemption is discontinued. A man only takes his right by inheritance\nwhich has been established for him. If his situation differs from\nthis, because the sale transaction is recent and he sees that the\nseller has concealed the price in order to sever his right of pre-\nemption, the value of the land is estimated, and he buys the land for\nthat price by his right of pre-emption. Then the buildings, plants, or\nstructures which are extra to the land are looked at, so he is in the\nposition of some one who bought the land for a known price, and then\nafter that built on it and planted. The owner of pre-emption takes\npossession after that is included.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Pre-emption\nis applied to the property of the deceased as it is applied to the\nproperty of the living. If the family of the deceased fear to break up\nthe property of the deceased, then they share it and sell it, and they\nhave no pre-emption in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"There is no pre-\nemption among us in a slave or a slave-girl or a camel, a cow, sheep,\nor any animal, nor in clothes or a well which does not have any\nuncultivated land around it. Pre-emption is in what can be usefully\ndivided, and in land in which boundaries occur. As for what cannot be\nusefully divided, there is no pre-emption in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"Some one who buys land in which people who are present have a right\nof pre-emption, refers them to the Sultan and either they claim their\nright or the Sultan surrenders it to him. If he were to leave them,\nand not refer their situation to the Sultan and they knew about his\npurchase, and then they left it until a long time had passed and then\ncame demanding their pre-emption, I do not think that they would have\nit.\"\n</p></b>",
