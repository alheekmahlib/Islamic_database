So he asked\npeople about him and they said, \"He has given directions for his\nsacrificial animal to be garlanded, and it is for that reason that he\nhas put on ihram .\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRabia said, \"I then met Abdullah ibn az-\nZubayr and so I mentioned this to him and he said, 'By the Lord of the\nKaba, an innovation.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik was asked about some one who\nset out with his own sacrificial animal and marked it and garlanded it\nat Dhu'l-Hulayfa, but did not go into ihram until he had reached al-\nJuhfa,and hesaid, \"I do not like that, and whoever does so has not\nacted properly. He should only garland his sacrificial animal, or mark\nit, when he goes into ihram, unless it is someone who does not intend\nto do hajj, in which case he sends it off and stays with his family.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik was asked if somone who was not in ihram could set out\nwith a sacrificial animal, and he said, \"Yes. There is no harm in\nthat.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was also asked to comment on the different views\npeople had about what became haram for some one who garlanded a\nsacrificial animal but did not intend to do either hajj or umra, and\nhe said, \"What we go by as far as this is concerned is what A'isha,\numm al-muminin said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and\ngrant him peace, sent his sacrificial animal off and did not go there\nhimself, and there was nothing that Allah had made halal for him that\nwas haram for him until the animal had been sacrificed.' \"\n</p></b>",

He answered, 'Whenever\nthere are alternatives in the Book of Allah for the kaffara, the\nculprit can choose to do whichever of the alternatives he prefers. As\nfor the sacrifice - a sheep, and as for the fasting - three days. As\nfor the food - feeding six poor men, for every poor man two mudds, by\nthe first mudd, the mudd of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant\nhim peace.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"I have heard one of the people of\nknowledge saying, 'When a person in ihram throws something and hits\ngame unintentionally and kills it, he must pay compensation. In the\nsame way, someone outside the Haram who throws anything into the Haram\nand hits game he did not intend to, killing it, has to pay\ncompensation, because the intentional and the mistaken are in the same\nposition in this matter.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, concerning people who\nkill game together while they are muhrim or in the Haram, \"I think\nthat each one of them owes a full share. If a sacrificial animal is\ndecided for them, each one of them owes one, and if fasting is decided\nfor them, the full fasting is owed by each one of them. The analogy of\nthat is a group of people who kill a man by mistake and the kaffara\nfor that is that each person among them must free a slave or fast two\nconsecutive months.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Anyone who stones or hunts\ngame after stoning the jamra and shaving his head but before he has\nperformed the tawaf al-ifada, owes compensation for that game, because\nAllah the Blessed, the Exalted said, 'And when you leave ihram, then\nhunt,' and restrictions still remain for someone who has not done the\ntawaf al-ifada about touching perfume and women.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said,\n\"The person in ihram does not owe anything for plants he cuts down in\nthe Haram and it has not reached us that anyone has given a decision\nof anything for it, but O how wrong is what he has done! \"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, concerning some one who was ignorant of, or who forgot the\nfast of three days in the hajj, or who was ill during them and so did\nnot fast them until he had returned to his community, \"He must offer a\nsacrificial animal (hady) if he can find one and if not he must fast\nthe three days among his people and the remaining seven after that.\"\n</p></b>",

And when Abu Ayyub al-\nAnsari and Habbar ibn al-Aswad came to the day of the sacrifice and\nhad missed the hajj, Umar ibn al-Khattab told them to come out of\nihram by doing umra and then to go home free of ihram and do hajj some\ntime in the future and to sacrifice an animal, or, if they could not\nfind one, to fast three days during the hajj and seven days after they\nhad returned to their families.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, \"Anyone who is\ndetained from doing hajj after he has gone into ihram, whether by\nillness or otherwise, or by an error in calculating the month or\nbecause the new moon is concealed from him is in the same position as\nsome one who is hindered from doing the hajj and must do the same as\nhe does.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYahya said that Malik was asked about the situation\nof someone from Makka who went into ihram for hajj and then broke a\nbone or had severe stomach pain, or of a woman who was in labour, and\nhe said, \"Someone to whom this happens is in the same situation as one\nwho is hindered from doing the hajj, and he must do the same as people\nfrom outlying regions do when they are hindered from doing the hajj.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMalik said, about someone who arrived in the months of the\nhajj with the intention of doing umra, and completed his umra and went\ninto ihram in Makka to do hajj, and then broke a bone or something\nelse happened to him which stopped him from being present at Arafa\nwith everybody else, \"I think that he should stay where he is until he\nis better and then go outside the area of the Haram, and then return\nto Makka and do tawaf of the House and say between Safa and Marwa, and\nthen leave ihram.
