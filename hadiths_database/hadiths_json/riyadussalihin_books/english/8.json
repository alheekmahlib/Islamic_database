        "hadithText": "Reported Mujibah Al-Bahiliyah on the authority of her father or uncle that he visited the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) once and then went to see him again after a year. His appearance had totally changed. He asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) if he had recognized him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked, \"Who are you?\" He replied: \"I am Al- Bahili who visited you last year.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"You were quite handsome, what has changed your appearance so much?\" He replied, \"Since my departure from here, I have not eaten anything except at night.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remarked, \"You have put yourself to torture. Observe Saum (fasting) during the Month of Patience (i.e., Ramadan) and fast one day from each month.\" He submitted, \"Permit me to observe more voluntary fasts because I have capacity to do so.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Then observe fasts for two days in every month.\" He said, \"Permit me to observe more.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Observe fasts on three days in every month.\" He requested that he should be allowed to observe more fasts. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Fast three days during the sacred months and omit fasting for three days alternately.\" He (ﷺ) joined his three fingers together and left them apart while repeating this sentence thrice.<br><br><b>[Abu Dawud]</b>.<br><br></b>",

As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.\" It was (again) asked: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?\" He (ﷺ) said, \"If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah's) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.\" It was asked: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?\" Upon this he (ﷺ) said, \"The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner.

I thought that he would go in Ruku' (bowing posture in Salat) at the end of one hundred Ayat, but he continued (reciting); and I thought that he would perhaps recite (this Surah) in the whole Rak'ah (prayer), but he continued the recitation; I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this Surah). He (ﷺ) then started reciting Surat An-Nisa' which he followed with Surat Al-Imran. He recited leisurely. When he recited an Ayah which mentioned the tasbeeh, he would say Subhan Allah and when he recited the Ayah which tells how the Rubb is to be asked, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would then ask from Him; and when he (ﷺ) recited an Ayah asking one to seek Protection Allah, he would seek Protection of Allah. Then he bowed and said, \"Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim (My Rubb the Great is free from imperfection)\"; his bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing, (and then on returning to the standing posture after Ruku') he would say, \"Sami' Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana lakal-hamd (Allah listens to him who praises Him. Praise be to You, Our Rubb!),\" and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say, \"Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la (My Rubb the Supreme is free from imperfection),\" and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing (Qiyam).<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

Somebody came to me and began to take away some food-stuff. I caught him and said, \"I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).\" He said, \"I am a needy man with a large family, and so I have a pressing need.\" I let him go. When I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) next morning, he asked me, \"O Abu Hurairah! What did your captive do last night?\" I said, \"O Messenger of Allah! He complained of a pressing need and a big family. I felt pity for him so I let him go.\" He (ﷺ) said, \"He told you a lie and he will return.\" I was sure, according to the saying of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that he would return. I waited for him. He sneaked up again and began to steal food-stuff from the Sadaqah. I caught him and said; \"I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).\" He said, \"Let go of me, I am a needy man. I have to bear the expenses of a big family. I will not come back.\" So I took pity on him and let him go. I went at dawn to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who asked me, \"O Abu Hurairah! What did your captive do last night?\" I replied, \"O Messenger of Allah! He complained of a pressing want and the burden of a big family. I took pity on him and so I let him go.\" He (ﷺ) said, \"He told you a lie and he will return.\" (That man) came again to steal the food-stuff. I arrested him and said, \"I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and this is the last of three times. You promised that you would not come again but you did.\" He said, \"Let go of me, I shall teach you some words with which Allah may benefit you.\" I asked, \"What are those words?\" He replied, \"When you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul- Kursi (2:255) for there will be a guardian appointed over you from Allah, and Satan will not be able to approach you till morning.\" So I let him go. Next morning the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked me, \"What did your prisoner do last night.\" I answered, \"He promised to teach me some words which he claimed will benefit me before Allah. So I let him go.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked, \"What are those words that he taught you?\" I said, \"He told me: 'When you go to bed, recite Ayat- ul-Kursi from the beginning to the end i.e.,<b>[ Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi encompasses the heavens and the earth, and preserving them does not fatigue Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Great]</b>.' (2:255). He added: 'By reciting it, there will be a guardian appointed over you from Allah who will protect you during the night, and Satan will not be able to come near you until morning'.\" The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Verily, he has told you the truth though he is a liar. O Abu Hurairah! Do you know with whom you were speaking for the last three nights?\" I said, \"No.\" He (ﷺ) said, \"He was Shaitan (Satan).\"<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari]</b>.<br><br></b>",
