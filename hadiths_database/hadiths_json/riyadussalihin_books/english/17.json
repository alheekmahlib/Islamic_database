        "hadithText": "Sumurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) very often used to ask his Companions, \"Do any one of you has seen a dream?\" So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah willed to relate. One day he (ﷺ) said, \"Last night I had a vision in which two men (angels) came to me and woke me up and said to me, 'Proceed!' I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's head, smashing it. When he struck him, the stone rolled away and he went after it to get it, and no sooner had he returned to this man, his head was healed and restored to its former condition. The thrower (of the rock) then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan-Allah! Who are these?' They said: 'Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded and came to a man lying in a prone position and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eyes from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he has done with the first side. He had hardly completed that (second) side when the first returned to its normal state. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan-Allah! Who are these?' They said, 'Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).\" I (the narrator) think the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"In that oven there was much noise and voices.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them they cried loudly. I asked, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed, proceed.' And so we proceeded and came across a river.\" I (the narrator) think he said, \"-- red like blood.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated. I asked my two companions, 'Who are these?' They replied, 'Proceed, proceed.' And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my two companions, 'Who is this (man).' They said to me, 'Proceed, proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen! I said to my two companions, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded till we came to a majestic, huge garden, greater and better than any garden I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, 'Ascend up' and I ascended up.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened; and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen! My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they came in the best shape.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further added, \"My two companions said to me: 'This place is the 'Adn Jannah, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, 'That palace is your place,' I said to them, 'May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied, 'As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).' I said to them, 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' They replied, 'We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon, whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. And the man who was given a stone to swallow is the eater of Ar-Riba (usury), and the bad-looking man whom you saw near the fire, kindling it and going around it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man you saw in the garden is (Prophet) Abraham, and the children around him are those who died upon Al-Fitrah (the Islamic Faith of Monotheism).\"' The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet (ﷺ) , \"O Messenger of Allah! What about the children of Al- Mushrikun (i.e., polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad (ﷺ))?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"And also the children of Al-Mushrikun.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added: \"My two companions added, 'The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were these people who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them'.\"<br><br>Another narration of Al-Bukhari is: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"One night two men came to me and took me to a blessed land.\" (The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told of the same incident as above) and said, \"After a while of walking we came upon a pit like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom with fire raging in it. When the flames rose up (the people in it) also rose up till they were about to come out; and when the fire subsided they, too, would go down with it. In it were naked men and women.\" (The remainder of the Hadith is the same as the above Hadith except that at the end of it, the Messenger of Allah said: \"We came upon a river of blood in the middle of which there was a man standing, and at the bank of the river there was a man with plenty of stones before him...\" In this narration we also find: \"They made me climb the tree and they made me enter an abode so beautiful the like of which I have never seen before. There (I saw) old men and youth.\" In this narration we also find: \"'The first house you entered was the abode of the believers in general, and the other house was the abode of the martyrs. I am Jibril (Gabriel), and this is Mika'il. Raise your head.' I looked up and saw something like clouds. They said to me, 'That is your abode.' I said, 'Shall I enter it?' They said, 'You have not completed your term of life yet. When you do, you will certainly enter it.\"'<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari]</b><br><br></b>",

'Abdullah bin Ubaiy (the chief of the hypocrites at Al- Madinah) said to his friends: \"Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) until they desert him.\" He also said: \"If we return to Al-Madinah, the more honourable (meaning himself, i.e., Abdullah bin Ubaiy) will drive out therefrom the meaner (meaning Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)).\" I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him about that and he sent someone to 'Abdullah bin Ubaiy. He asked him whether he had said that or not. Abdullah took an oath that he had not done anything of that sort and said that it was Zaid who carried a false tale to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Zaid said: I was so much perturbed because of this until this Verse was revealed verifying my statement:<br><br>\"When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad (ﷺ)), they say: 'We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.' Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed.\" (63:1) Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the hypocrites in order to seek forgiveness for them from Allah, but they turned away their heads.<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

As he reached at Sargh (a town by the side of Hijaz) he came across the governor of Al-Ajnad, Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) and his companions. They informed him that an   had broken out in Syria. Ibn 'Abbas relates: 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said to me: \"Call to me the earliest Muhajirun (Emigrants).\" So I called them. He sought their advice and told them that an epidemic had broken out in Ash-Sham. There was a difference of opinion whether they should proceed further or retreat to their homes in such a situation. Some of them said: \"You have set forth to fight the enemy, and therefore you should not go back;\" whereas some of them said: \"As you have along with you many eminent Companions of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we would not advice you to set forth to the place of the plague (and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).\" 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: \"You can now go away.\" He said: \"Call to me the Ansar (the Helpers).\" So I called them to him, and he consulted them and they differed in their opinions as well. He said: \"Now, you may go.\" He again said: \"Call the old (wise people) of the Quraish who had emigrated before the conquest of Makkah.\" I called them. 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) consulted them in this issue and not even two persons among them differed in the opinions. They said: \"We think that you should go back along with the people and do not take them to this scourge. 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) made an announcement to the people, saying: \"In the morning I intend to go back, and I want you to do the same.\" Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree?\" Thereupon 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: \"O Abu 'Ubaidah ! Had it been someone else to say this.\" ('Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) did not like to differ with him). He said: \"Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree to the Divine Decree. What do you think if you have camels and you happen to get down a valley having two sides, one of them covered with foliage and the other being barren, will you not act according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in vegetative land? In case you graze them in the barren land, even then you will be doing so according to the Divine Decree.<br><br>There happened to come 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf who had been absent for some of his needs. He said: I have knowledge about it. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying, \"If you get wind of the outbreak of plague in a land, you should not enter it; but if it spreads in the land where you are, you should not depart from it.\" Thereupon 'Umar bin Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) praised Allah and went back.<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",
