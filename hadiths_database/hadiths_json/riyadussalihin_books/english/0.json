A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: 'Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.' Thereupon, one of them said: 'O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock'. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape. The next said: 'O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.' The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out. The third one said: 'O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours - camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.'

        "hadithText": "Zirr bin Hubaish reported: I went to Safwan bin 'Assal (May Allah be pleased with him) to inquire about wiping with wet hands over light boots while performing Wudu'. He asked me, \"What brings you here, Zirr?\" I answered: \"Search for knowledge\". He said, \"Angels spread their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of joy for what he seeks\". I told him, \"I have some doubts in my mind regarding wiping of wet hands over light boots in the course of performing Wudu' after defecation or urinating. Now since you are one of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), I have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the Prophet (ﷺ) concerning it?\". He replied in the affirmative and said, \"He (ﷺ) instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). In other cases such as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands over light boots will suffice.\" I, then, questioned him, \"Did you hear him say anything about love and affection?\" He replied, \"We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a journey when a bedouin called out in a loud voice, 'O Muhammad.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied him in the same tone, 'Here I am.' I said to him (the bedouin), 'Woe to you, lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.' He said, 'By Allah! I will not lower my voice,' and then addressing the Prophet (ﷺ) he said, 'What about a person who loves people but has not found himself in their company.' Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied, 'On the Day of Resurrection, a person will be in the company of those whom he loves.' The Messenger of Allah then kept on talking to us and in the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years\".<br><br>Sufyan, one of the narrators of this tradition, said: \"This gateway is in the direction of Syria. Allah created it on the day He created the heavens and the earth. It is open for repentance and will not be shut until the sun rises from that direction (i.e., the West) (on Doomsday)\".<br><br><b>[At-Tirmidhi, who categorised it as Hadith Hasan Sahih]</b><br><br></b>",

He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred. He then asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the affirmative and asked, 'Who stands between you and repentance? Go to such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place.' So he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The angels of mercy pleaded, 'This man has come with a repenting heart to Allah,' and the angels of punishment argued, 'He never did a virtuous deed in his life.' Then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them. He said, 'Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.' They measured and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul\".<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.</b>",

        "hadithText": "Abdullah bin Ka'b, who served as the guide of Ka'b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) when he became blind, narrated: I heard Ka'b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) narrating the story of his remaining behind instead of joining Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he left for the battle of Tabuk. Ka'b said: \"I accompanied Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle of Tabuk and the battle of Badr. As for the battle of Badr, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the Muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of the Quraish. Allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. I had the honour of being with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the night of 'Aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was dearer to me than participating in the battle of Badr, although Badr was more well-known among the people than that. And this is the account of my staying behind from the battle of Tabuk. I never had better means and more favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. And by Allah, I had never before possessed two riding-camels as I did during the time of this expedition. Whenever Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) decided to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the last moment (of departure). But on this expedition, he set out in extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual position so that they should make full preparation for the campaign. And the Muslims who accompanied Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at that time were in large number but no proper record of them was maintained.\" Ka'b (further) said: \"Few were the persons who chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves (and thus remain undetected) unless Revelation from Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious (revealed relating to them). And Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was sought. I had a weakness for them and it was during this season that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the Muslims made preparations. I also would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but would come back having done nothing and said to myself: 'I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like'. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out along with the Muslims, but I had made no preparations. I would go early in the morning and come back, but with no decision. I went on doing so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. Then I wished to march on and join them. Would that I had done that! But perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) whenever I went out, I was grieved to find no good example to follow but confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom Allah had exempted (from marching forth for Jihad). Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made no mention of me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting with the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What happened to Ka'b bin Malik?' A person from Banu Salimah said: \"O Messenger of Allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an appreciation of his finery have detained him.' Upon this Mu'adh bin Jabal (MatAllah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): \"By Allah, we know nothing about him but good.' Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), however, kept quiet. At that time he (the Prophet (ﷺ)) saw a person dressed in white and said, 'Be Abu Khaithamah.' And was Abu Khaithamah Al- Ansari was the person who had contributed a Sa' of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.\" Ka'b bin Malik further said: \"When the news reached me that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was on his way back from Tabuk, I was greatly distressed. I thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger the next day. In this connection, I sought the counsels of every prudent member of my family. When I was told that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas vanished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing but the truth could save me. So I decided to tell him the truth. It was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) arrived in Al-Madinah. It was his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go to the mosque and perform two Rak'ah (of optional prayer) and would then sit with the people. When he sat, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. They were more than eighty in number. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to Allah, until I appeared before him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He then said to me, 'Come forward'. I went forward and I sat in front of him. He said to me, 'What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride?' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and I have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware that if I were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you, Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. In case, I speak the truth, you may be angry with me, but I hope that Allah would be pleased with me (and accept my repentance). By Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind.' Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, 'This man spoke the truth, so get up (and wait) until Allah gives a decision about you.' I left and some people of Banu Salimah followed me. They said to me, 'By Allah, we do not know that you committed a sin before. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) like those who stayed behind him. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would have sought forgiveness for you.' By Allah, they kept on reproaching me until I thought of going back to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and retract my confession. Then I said to them, 'Has anyone else met the same fate?' They said, 'Yes, two persons have met the same fate. They made the same statement as you did and the same verdict was delivered in their case.' I asked, 'Who are they?' They said, 'Murarah bin Ar-Rabi' Al-'Amri and Hilal bin Umaiyyah Al- Waqifi.' They mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I was confirmed in my original resolve. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prohibited the Muslims to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in fact the same atmosphere of which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent (most of their) time weeping. As I was the youngest and the strongest, I would leave my house, attend the congregational Salat, move about in the bazaars, but none would speak to me. I would come to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as he sat amongst (people) after the Salat, greet him and would ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings. Then I would perform Salat near him and look at him stealthily. When I finish my Salat, he would look at me and when I would cast a glance at him he would turn away his eyes from me. When the harsh treatment of the Muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, I walked and I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin, and I had a great love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not answer to my greeting. I said to him, 'O Abu Qatadah, I adjure you in the Name of Allah, are you not aware that I love Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ)?' I asked him the same question again but he remained silent. I again adjured him, whereupon he said, 'Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) know better.' My eyes were filled with tears, and I came back climbing down the wall.<br><br>As I was walking in the bazaars of Al-Madinah, a man from the Syrian peasants, who had come to sell food grains in Al-Madinah, asked people to direct him to Ka'b bin Malik. People pointed towards me. He came to me and delivered a letter from the King of Ghassan, and as I was a scribe, I read that letter whose purport was: 'It has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Prophet (ﷺ)) was treating you harshly. Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place; so come to us and we shall receive you graciously.' As I read that letter I said: 'This is too a trial,' so I put it to fire in an oven. When forty days had elapsed and Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) received no Revelation, there came to me a messenger of the Messenger of Allah and said, 'Verily, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has commanded you to keep away from your wife.' I said, 'Should I divorce her or what else should I do?' He said, 'No, but only keep away from her and don't have sexual contact with her.' The same message was sent to my companions. So, I said to my wife: 'You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case.' The wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah came to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umaiyyah is a senile person and has no servant. Do you disapprove if I serve him?' He said, 'No, but don't let him have any sexual contact with you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no such desire left in him. By Allah, he has been in tears since (this calamity) struck him.' Members of my family said to me, 'You should have sought permission from Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in regard to your wife. He has allowed the wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah to serve him.' I said, 'I would not seek permission from Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for I do not know what Messenger of Allah might say in response to that, as I am a young man'. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty days had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to us. After I had offered my Fajr prayer on the early morning of the fiftieth day of this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had sat in the very state which Allah described as: 'The earth seemed constrained for me despite its vastness', I heard the voice of a proclaimer from the peak of the hill Sal' shouting at the top of his voice: 'O Ka'b bin Malik, rejoice.' I fell down in prostration and came to know that there was (a message of) relief for me. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had informed the people about the acceptance of our repentance by Allah after he had offered the Fajr prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my companions in order to give them the glad tidings. A man spurred his horse towards me (to give the good news), and another one from the tribe of Aslam came running for the same purpose and, as he approached the mount, I received the good news which reached me before the rider did. When the one whose voice I had heard came to me to congratulate me, I took off my garments and gave them to him for the good news he brought to me. By Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) except these garments, at that time. Then I borrowed two garments, dressed myself and came to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) On my way, I met groups of people who greeted me for (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: 'Congratulations for acceptance of your repentance.' I reached the mosque where Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting amidst people. Talhah bin 'Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me, shook hands with me and greeted me. By Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the Muhajirun besides him.\" Ka'b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talhah. Ka'b further said: \"I greeted Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with 'As-salamu 'alaikum' and his face was beaming with pleasure. He (ﷺ) said, 'Rejoice with the best day you have ever seen since your mother gave you birth. 'I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Is this (good news) from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' And it was common with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) that when ever he was happy, his face would glow as if it were a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognized it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said, I have placed a condition upon myself that if Allah accepts my Taubah, I would give up all of my property in charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ)!' Thereupon Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, 'Keep some property with you, as it is better for you.' I said, 'I shall keep with me that portion which is in Khaibar'. I added: 'O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and therefore, repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long as I am alive.\" Ka'b added: \"By Allah, I do not know anyone among the Muslims who has been granted truthfulness better than me since I said this to the Prophet (ﷺ). By Allah! Since the time I made a pledge of this to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I have never intended to tell a lie, and I hope that Allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the rest of my life. Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious, revealed these Verses:<br><br>'Allah has forgiven the Prophet (ﷺ), the Muhajirun (Muslim Emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar (Muslims of Al- Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad (ﷺ)) in the time of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three who did not join <b>[the Tabuk expedition and whose case was deferred (by the Prophet (ﷺ)) for Allah's Decision]</b> till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His Pardon <b>[repent (unto Him)]</b>. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in word and deeds).\" (9:117,118).<br><br>Ka'b said: \"By Allah, since Allah guided me to Islam, there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who had told lies, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else, as He sent down the Revelation:<br><br>They will swear by Allah to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijsun <b>[i.e., Najasun (impure) because of their evil deeds]</b>, and Hell is their dwelling place - a recompense for that which they used to earn. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are Al- Fa'siqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)\". (9:95,96)<br><br>Ka'b further added: \"The matter of the three of us remained pending for decision apart from the case of those who had made excuses on oath before Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he accepted those, took fresh oaths of allegiance from them and supplicated for their forgiveness. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept our matter pending till Allah decided it. The three whose matter was deferred have been shown mercy. The reference here is not to our staying back from the expedition but to his delaying our matter and keeping it pending beyond the matter of those who made their excuses on oath which he accepted\".<br><br><b>[Al- Bukhari and Muslim]</b><br><br>Another version adds: \"Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out for Tabuk on Thursday. He used to prefer to set out on journey on Thursday.\" Another version says: \"Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to come back from a journey in the early forenoon and went straight to the mosque where he would perform two Rak'ah prayer. Afterwards he would seat himself there\".<br><br></b>",

        "hadithText": "Suhaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"There lived a king before you and he had a court magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: 'I have grown old, so send me a young boy in order to teach him magic.' The king sent him a young boy to serve the purpose. And on his way (to the magician) the young boy met a monk to whom he listened to and liked it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician, he would meet the monk and sit there and would come to the magician (late). The magician used to beat him because of this delay. He complained about this to the monk who said to him: 'When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family detained me. And when you fear your family, say: The magician detained me.' It so happened that there came a huge beast and it blocked the way of the people, and the young boy said: 'I will know today whether the magician or the monk is better.' He picked up a stone and said: 'O Allah, if the way of the monk is dearer to You than the way of the magician, bring about death to the animal so that the people be able to move about freely.' He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people began to move about freely. He then came to the monk and told him the story. The monk said: 'Son, today you are superior to me. You have come to a stage where I feel that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not reveal me.' That young boy began to heal those born blind and the lepers and he, in fact, began to cure people from all kinds of illnesses. When a courtier of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said, 'If you cure me, all these things will be yours.' He said, 'I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah, the Exalted, Alone Who cures; and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate to Allah to cure you.' This courtier affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him, 'Who restored your eyesight?' He said, 'My Rubb.' Thereupon he said, 'Do you have another lord besides me?' He said, 'My Rubb and your Rubb is Allah.' So the king kept torturing him untill he revealed the young boy. The young boy was thus summoned and the king said to him, 'O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and the lepers and you do such and such.' Thereupon he said, 'I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Alone Who cures,' and the king took hold of him and began to torture him until he revealed of the monk. The monk was summoned and it was said to him: 'You should turn back from your religion.' But he refused. The king sent for a saw, placed it in the middle of his head and cut him into two parts that fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought forward and it was said to him: 'Turn back from your religion.' He, too, refused, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and he was torn into two parts. Then the boy was sent for and it was said to him: 'Turn back from your religion.' He refused. The king then handed him over to a group of his courtiers, and said to them: 'Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its peak ask him to renounce his Faith. If he refuses to do so, push him to his death.' So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: 'O Allah, save me from them in any way you like,' and the mountain began to shake and they all fell down (dead) and that young boy came walking to the king. The king said to him, 'What happened to your companions?' He said, 'Allah has saved me from them.' He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: 'Take him and carry him in a boat and when you reach the middle of the sea, ask him to renounce his religion. If he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).' So they took him and he said: 'O Allah, save me from them.' The boat turned upside down and they all drowned except the young boy who came walking to the king. The king said to him, 'What happened to your companions?' He said, 'Allah has saved me from them,' and he said to the king: 'You cannot kill me until you do what I command you to do.' The king asked, 'What is that?' He said, 'Gather all people in one place and tie me up to the trunk of a tree, then take an arrow from my quiver and say: With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the boy; then shoot me. If you do that you will be able to kill me.' 'The king called the people in an open field and tied the young boy to the trunk of a tree. He took out an arrow from his quiver, fixed in the bow and said, 'With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the young boy,' he then shot the arrow and it hit the boy's temple. The young boy placed his hand upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and died. The people then said: 'We believe in the Rubb of this young boy.' The king was told: 'Do you see what you were afraid of, by Allah it has taken place; all people have believed.' The king then commanded that trenches be dug and fire lit in them, and said: 'He who would not turn back from his (the young boy's) religion, throw him in the fire' or 'he would be ordered to jump into it.' They did so till a woman came with her child. She felt hesitant in jumping into the fire. The child said to her: 'O mother! Endure (this ordeal) for you are on the Right Path\".<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

When he came back, he inquired, \"How is the boy?\". Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, \"Better than before\". Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: \"Arrange for the burial of the boy\". In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him of the event. He enquired, \"Did you sleep together last night?\" Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which the Prophet (ﷺ) supplicated, \"O Allah bless them.\" Thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: \"Take up the boy and carry him to the Prophet (ﷺ)\"; and he sent some dates with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) enquired, \"Is there anything with him?\" He said; \"Yes, some dates\". The Prophet (ﷺ) took a date, chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date around the baby's gum and named him 'Abdullah.<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br>The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn 'Uyainah relates that a man from the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this 'Abdullah, every one of whom had committed the Noble Qur'an to memory.<br><br>The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of the family: \"Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son until I mention it to him myself.\" Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said, \"O Abu Talhah! If some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.\" He said, \"No\". She said, \"Then hope reward for your son\". Abu Talhah got angry, and said; \"You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. \"He went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him about the matter. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"May Allah bless the night you spent together!\" He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. When Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to come back to Al-Madinah from a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people came near Al- Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained with her and Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: \"O Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.\" Umm Sulaim then said: \"O Abu Talhah, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to me: \"O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) tomorrow morning.\" The next morning I carried the baby with me to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and narrated the rest of the story.<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the 'Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man's hand stuck to his, he said: \"There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me\". (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: \"The thief is among you\". They brought him a head of gold like a cow's head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us\".<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

No signs of fatigue of journey appeared on him and he was known to none of us. He sat down facing the Prophet (ﷺ) leaning his knees against the knees of the Prophet (ﷺ) and placing both of his palms over his two thighs and said, \"O Muhammad (ﷺ)! Tell me about Islam\". He (ﷺ) replied, \"Islam is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad (ﷺ) is the Messenger of Allah; that you observe Salat (prayers), pay Zakat, observe Saum (fasting) of Ramadan and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) of the House, provided you have resources of making journey to it.\" He replied: \"You have spoken the truth.\" We were surprised to see that he had asked him and confirmed the correctness of the answers. He then enquired: \"Tell me about Iman.\" He (ﷺ) said: \"It is to believe in Allah, His angels,  His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day and that you believe in preordainment (destiny), its bad and good consequences.\" He said, \"You have spoken the truth.\" He then enquired: \"Tell me about Ihsan.\" He (ﷺ) said, \"It is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him; and although you do not see Him, He sees you.\" He enquired: \"Inform me about the Hour (i.e., the Day of Resurrection).\" He (ﷺ) replied, \"I have no more knowledge thereof than you\". He said, \"Inform me about some of its signs.\" He (ﷺ) said, \"They are - that a bondswoman gives birth to her own master, and that you will find the barefooted, naked, poor shepherds competing one another in the construction of higher buildings.\" Then he departed. The Messenger of Allah kept silent for a while then he said to me, \"O 'Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?\" I replied, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"He was Jibril (Gabriel); he came to you to teach you your religion.\"<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b><br><br></b>",

Allah wanted to test them. He therefore, sent to them an angel who came to the leper and asked him what he would like best. He replied: \"A good colour, a good skin and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people\". He (the angel) rubbed him and his loathsomeness vanished and he was given a good colour and a good skin. He then asked him what type of property he would like best. The leper replied that he would like camels - <b>[or perhaps he said cattle, for Ishaq (one of the subnarrator of the Hadith) was uncertain, either said: 'Camels,' or: 'Cattle']</b>. He was given a pregnant she-camel. The angel invoked for Allah's Blessing on it. The angel then went to the bald man and asked him what he would like best and he replied: \"Good hair and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people\". The angel ran his hand over him and he was given good hair. He then asked him what property he would like best. He replied that he would like cattle, so he was given a pregnant cow. The angel invoked Allah's Blessing on it. The angel then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best, and he replied: \"I wish that Allah restore my sight to me so that I may see people.\" Thereupon the angel ran his hand over him and Allah restored his sight. The angel then asked what property he would like best. He replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant ewe. Flocks and herds were produced for the three men, the first having a valley full of camels, the second one, a valley full of cows and the third one full of sheep. Then the angel came in the form of a leper, to the one who had been a leper, and said: \"I am a poor man and my resources have been exhausted in my journey, and my only means of reaching my destination are dependent on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property, for a camel by which I may get to my destination\". He replied: \"I have many dues to pay.\" The angel then said: \"I think I recognize you. Were you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom Allah gave property?\" He replied: \"I inherited this property through generations\". The angel said: \"If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition\". The angel went in the form of a bald man to the one who had been bald, and said the same as he had said to the former and received a similar reply. So he said: \"If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition\". The angel then went to the one who had been blind and said: \"I am a poor traveller and my resources have been exhausted in my journey. My only means of reaching my destination are dependant on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who restored your eyesight for a sheep by which I may get to the end of my journey\". He replied: \"Yes, I was blind. Allah restored my eyesight, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by Allah that I shall not argue with you today to return anything you take, as I give it for Allah's sake\". The angel said: \"Keep your property. You have all simply been put to a test, and Allah is pleased with you and displeased with both of your companions\".<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

I saw a Prophet who had a very small group (less than ten in total) with him, another Prophet who was accompanied by only one or two men and some did not have even one. Suddenly I was shown a huge crowd and I thought that they were my Ummah, but I was told: 'This is Musa (Moses) and his people, but look towards the other side.' I looked and beheld a great assemblage. I was told: 'These are your people and amongst them there are seventy thousand who shall enter Jannah without being taken to account or torment\". Then the Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and went into his apartment, and the Companions began to guess who may be those people who would enter Jannah without any accounting or torment. Some said: \"Probably, they are the ones who kept company with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)\". Others said: \"Probably, they are the ones who have been born as Muslims and have never associated anyone with Allah in worship\". Then Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out and asked, \"What are you discussing?\" So they told him. He then said, \"They are those who do not make Ruqyah (blowing over themselves after reciting the Qur'an or some prayers and supplications the Prophet (ﷺ) used to say) nor seek it, nor perceive omens (i.e., they are not pessimistic) but keep trust in their Rubb (Allah).\" On this 'Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and asked: \"Pray to Allah to make me one of them.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"You are one of them.\" Then another man stood up and asked the same thing. The Prophet (ﷺ) answered, \"'Ukashah has surpassed you\".<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans, and if Allah let me participate in a battle against the pagans, Allah will see what I do.\" So he encountered the day of Uhud Battle. The Muslims left the positions (the Prophet (ﷺ) told them to keep) and were defeated, he said: \"O Allah! excuse these people (i.e., the Muslims) for what they have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done\". Then he went forward with his sword and met Sa'd bin Mu'adh (fleeing) and said to him: \"By the Rubb of the Ka'bah! I can smell the fragrance of Jannah from a place closer than Uhud Mount\". Sa'd said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what he did was beyond my power\". Anas said: \"We saw over eighty wounds on his body caused by stabbing, striking and shooting of arrows and spears. We found that he was killed, and mutilated by the polytheists. Nobody was able to recognize him except his sister who recognized him by the tips of his fingers.\" Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: \"We believe that the Ayah 'Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah <b>[i.e., they have gone out for Jihad (holy fighting), and showed not their backs to the disbelievers]</b>...' (33:23), refers to him and his like\".<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

Some of them disliked it and said to 'Umar: \"Why do you bring in this boy to sit with us when we have sons like him?\" 'Umar replied: \"Because of the status he has, which you already know about (i.e., belongs to the source of knowledge and the house of the Prophet (ﷺ)).\" One day, 'Umar called me and seated me in the gathering of those people; and I think that he called me just to show them (of my religious knowledge). 'Umar then questioned them (in my presence). \"How do you interpret the ayah of Allah: 'When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (ﷺ) against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah).\"' Someone said that when Allah's Help and the Conquest (of Makkah) came to us, we were called upon to celebrate the Praise of Allah and ask for His forgiveness. Some others remained silent and did not utter a word. Thereupon 'Umar asked me: \"Ibn 'Abbas! Do you say the same.\" I replied: \"No\". He said: \"What do you say then?\" I replied: \"That is the sign of the Prophet's death about which he had been informed. Allah, the Exalted, says:<br><br>'When there comes the help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (ﷺ) against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah)'.<br><br>So declare the remoteness of your Rubb from every imperfection, and ask for His forgiveness.

Salman requested Abud-Darda' to eat (with him) but Abud-Darda' said: \"I am fasting.\" Salman said: \"I am not going to eat unless you eat.\" So, Abud-Darda' ate (with Salman). When it was night and (a part of the night passed), Abud-Darda' got up (to offer the night prayer) but Salman asked him to sleep and Abud-Darda' slept. After some time Abud-Darda' again got up but Salman asked him to sleep. When it was the last hours of the night, Salman asked him to get up and both of them offered (Tahajjud) prayer. Then Salman told Abud-Darda': \"You owe a duty to your Rubb, you owe a duty to your body; you owe a duty to your family; so you should give to every one his due. Abud-Darda' came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and reported the whole story. Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Salman is right\".<br><br><b>[Al- Bukhari]</b>.<br><br></b>",

        "hadithText": "'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) was informed that I said that I would perform prayers the whole night and observe fasting every day as long as I live. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Is it you who said this?\" I said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! I ransom you with my parents, it is I who said that.\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"You will not be able to do that. Observe fast and break it; sleep and get up for prayer, and observe fast for three days during the month; for every good is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to fasting the whole year.\" I said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I can do more than that.\" He said, \"Observe fast one day and leave off the next two days.\" I said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I have strength to do more than that.\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Observe fast every other day, and that is the fasting of Dawud (ﷺ) and that is the most moderate fasting\".<br><br>According to another narration: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"That is the best fasting.\" I said, \"But I am capable of doing more than this\". Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"There is nothing better than this.\" 'Abdullah bin 'Amr (May Allah be pleased with them) said (when he grew old): \"Had I accepted the three days (fasting during every month) as the Messenger of Allah had said, it would have been dearer to me than my family and my property\".<br><br>In another narration 'Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me, \"O 'Abdullah! Have I not been informed that you observe fast during the day and offer prayer all the night.\" I replied, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah!\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Don't do that. Observe fast for few days and then leave off for few days, perform prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right upon you, and your eyes have a right upon you; and your wife has a right upon you; your visitors have a right upon you. It is sufficient for you to observe fast three days in a month, as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting the whole year.\" I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction. I said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I have strength.\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Observe fast like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (ﷺ); and do not fast more than that.\" I said: \"How was the fasting of Prophet Dawud?\" He (ﷺ) said, \"Half of the year (i.e., he used to fast on every alternate day).\"<br><br>Afterwards when 'Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) grew old, he used to say: \"Would that I had availed myself of the concession granted to me by Messenger of Allah.\"<br><br>In another narration 'Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"I have been informed that you observe fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur'an) every night.\" I said, \"Messenger of Allah! It is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good,\" whereupon he (ﷺ) said, \"Then observe fasts like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (ﷺ) as he was the most ardent worshipper of Allah; recite the Qur'an once every month.\" I said, \"O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of doing more than that.\" He said, \"Then recite it (the complete Qur'an) in every twenty days.\" I said, \"O Prophet of Allah I am capable of reciting more than that.\" He said, \"Then recite it once in every ten days.\" I said, \"O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of reciting more than that.\" He said, \"Then recite it once in every seven days, but not recite more than that.\" The Prophet of Allah also said to me, \"You do not know, you may have a longer life\". When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted to me by) the Prophet of Allah.<br><br>In another narration 'Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"The best fasting with Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud, and the best prayer with Allah is that of Dawud (ﷺ) for he would sleep half of the night and stand for prayer for the third of it and (then) would sleep sixth part of it; he observed fast one day and leave off the other. He would not flee on meeting the enemy\".<br><br>In another narration 'Abdullah is reported to have said: My father helped me marry a noble woman and he used to inquire of his daughter-in-law regarding her husband. She would say: \"He is, indeed, a fine man. Since I have come to him, he has neither stepped on my bed nor he has had sexual intercourse with me\". When this state of affairs lasted for some time, my father mentioned the matter to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who directed my father saying, \"Send him to me\". I went to him accordingly. He asked me, \"How often do you observe fast?\" I replied; \"Daily\". He asked me, \"How long do you take in reading the Noble Qur'an completely.\" I said, \"Once every night\". Then he narrated the whole story. He (in his old age) would recite one seventh of his nightly recitation to some members of his family during the day to lighten his task at night. Whenever he wished to have a relief from his fast on alternate days, he would give up fasting for a few days and make up deficiency later by observing the number of fasts he had missed. He would not give up the number of fasts altogether because he did not like to abandon what he had settled with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).<br><br></b>",

Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you.\" (4:1) He also recited the Ayah which is in the end of Surat Al-Hashr: \"O you who believe! Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every one look what he has sent forth for the tomorrow\". (59:18). Thereafter, every man gave in charity Dinar, Dirham, clothes, measure-fulls of wheat and measure-fulls of dates till he said: \"(Give in charity) be it half a date\". Then a man of the Ansar came with a bag which was difficult for him to hold in his hand. Thereafter, the people came successively (with charity) till I saw two heaps of food and clothes. I noticed that the face of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was glowing like that of the bright moon or glittering gold. Then he (ﷺ) said, \"Whosoever introduces a good practice in Islam, there is for him its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him without anything being diminished from their rewards. And whosoever introduces an evil practice in Islam, will shoulder its sin and the sins of all those who will act upon it, without diminishing in any way their burden\"<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

Then he would meet him the next day and find no change in him, but this would not prevent him from eating with him, drinking with him and sitting in his assemblies. When it came to this, Allah led their hearts into evil ways on account of their association with others.\" Then he (ﷺ) recited, \"Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud (David) and 'Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. They used not to forbid one another from the Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do. You see many of them taking the disbelievers as their Auliya' (protectors and helpers). Evil indeed is that which their own selves have sent forward before them; for that (reason) Allah's wrath fell upon them and in torment will they abide. And had they believed in Allah and in the Prophet (Muhammad (ﷺ)) and in what has been revealed to him, never would they have taken them (the disbelievers) as Auliya' (protectors and helpers); but many of them are the Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).\" (5:78-81)<br><br>Then he (ﷺ) continued: \"Nay, by Allah, you either enjoin good and forbid evil and catch hold of the hand of the oppressor and persuade him to act justly and stick to the truth, or, Allah will involve the hearts of some of you with the hearts of others and will curse you as He had cursed them\".<br><br><b>[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who categorized it as Hadith Hasan]</b>.<br><br>The wording in At-Tirmidhi is: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"When the Children of Israel became sinful, their learned men prohibited them but they would not turn back.

Then the Qur'an was revealed and they learnt from the Quran and they learned from the Sunnah.\" Then the (Prophet (ﷺ)) told us about the removal of Amanah. He said, \"The man would have some sleep, and Amanah would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark. He would again sleep, and Amanah would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having nothing in it.\" He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) then took up a pebble and rolled it over his foot and said, \"The people would enter into transactions with one another and hardly a person would be left who would return (things) entrusted to him (and there would look like an honest person) till it would be said: 'In such and such tribe there is a trustworthy man.' And they would also say about a person: 'How prudent he is! How handsome he is and how intelligent he is!' whereas in his heart there would be no grain of Faith.\" Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman (May Allah bepleased with him) added: I had a time when I did not care with whom amongst you I did business, I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim, his Faith would compel him to discharge his obligation to me; and if he were a Christian or a Jew, his guardian (surety) would compel him to discharge his obligation to me.

I expect that I shall be the the wronged one today. I am much worried about my debt. Do you think that anything will be left over from our property after the payment of my debt? My son, sell our property and pay off my debt.\" Az-Zubair then willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely 'Abdullah's sons. He said, \"One-third of the one-third. If any property is left after the payment of debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left is to be given to your sons.\" (Hisham, a subnarrator added: \"Some of the sons of 'Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair, e.g., Khubaib and Abbad. 'Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time)\". (The narrator 'Abdullah added:) He kept on instructing me about his debts and then said: \"My son, should you find yourself unable to pay any portion of my debt then beseech my Master for His help.\" By Allah, I did not understand what he meant and asked: \"Father, who is your Master?\" He said: \"Allah.\" By Allah! Whenever I faced a difficulty in discharging any portion of his debt; I would pray: \"O Master of Zubair, discharge his debt,\" and He discharged it. Zubair was martyred. He left no money, but he left certain lands, one of them in Al-Ghabah, eleven houses in Al-Madinah, two in Basrah, one in Kufah and one in Egypt. The cause of his indebtedness was that a person would come to him asking him to keep some money of his in trust for him. Zubair would refuse to accept it as a trust, fearing it might be lost, but would take it as a loan. He never accepted a governorship, or revenue office, or any public office. He fought along with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman (May Allah be pleased with them).<br><br>'Abdullah added: I prepared a statement of his debts and they amounted to two million and two hundred thousand! Hakim bin Hizam met me and asked me: \"Nephew, how much is due from my brother as debt?\" I kept it as secret and said: \"A hundred thousand.\" Hakim said: \"By Allah! I do not think your assets are sufficient for the payment of these debts.\" I said: \"What would you think if the amount were two million and two hundred thousand?\" He said: \"I do not think that you would be able to clear off the debts. If you find it difficult let me know.\"<br><br>Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) had purchased the land in Al-Ghabah for a hundred and seventy thousand. 'Abdullah sold it for a million and six hundred thousand, and declared that whosoever had a claim against Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) should see him in Al-Ghabah. 'Abdullah bin Ja'far (May Allah bepleased with him) came to him and said: \"Az- Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) owed me four hundred thousand, but I would remit the debt if you wish.\" 'Abdullah (May Allah bepleased with him) said: \"No.\" Ibn Ja'far said: ''If you would desire for postponement I would postpone the recovery of it.\" 'Abdullah said: \"No.\" Ibn Ja'far then said: \"In that case, measure out a plot for me.\" 'Abdullah marked out a plot. Thus he sold the land and discharged his father's debt. There remained out of the land four and a half shares. He then visited Mu'awiyah who had with him at the time 'Amr bin 'Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam'ah (May Allah bepleased with them). Mu'awiyah (May Allah bepleased with him) said: \"What price did you put on the land in Al-Ghabah?\" He said: \"One hundred thousand for a each share. Mu'awiyah inquired: \"How much of it is left?\" 'Abdullah said: \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said: \"I will buy one share for a hundred thousand\". 'Amr bin 'Uthman said: \"I will buy one share for a hundred thousand\". Ibn Zam'ah said: \"I will buy one share for a hundred thousand.\" Then Mu'awiyah asked: \"How much of it is now left?\" 'Abdullah said: \"One and a half share. Mu'awiyah said: \"I will take it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" Later 'Abdullah bin Ja'far sold his share to Mu'awiyah for six hundred thousand.<br><br>When 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) finished the debts, the heirs of Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) asked him to distribute the inheritance among them. He said: \"I will not do that until I announce during four successive Hajj seasons: 'Let he who has a claim against Az-Zubair come forward and we shall discharge it.\"' He made this declaration on four Hajj seasons and then distributed the inheritance among the heirs of Az-Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) according to his will. Az- Zubair (May Allah bepleased with him) had four wives. Each of them received a million and two hundred thousand. Thus Az-Zubair's total property was amounted to fifty million and two hundred thousand.<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari]</b></b>",

The time for Salat approached and Bilal (May Allah be pleased with them) went to Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) and said to him: \"Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has got late and it is the time for Salat.

Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) stepped forward and commenced As- Salat. (He recited Takbir and the people followed him). In the meantime, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) arrived and, passing through the rows, took his stand in the first row. The people started clapping. It was the habit of Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) that whenever he started praying, he would never look round. He paid no heed (to the clapping). When the clapping increased, he turned round and saw Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) beckoned him to continue performing Salat. But Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) raised his hands and praised Allah. Then he retreated, taking his steps backwards. When Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that, he went ahead and led Salat. When he finished Salat, he faced the congregation and said, \"Why do you clap when something happens during the Salat. Clapping is only for women. If something happens in the course of Salat you should say, Subhan Allah. It is bound to attract attention. And you, Abu Bakr, what prevented you from carrying on with Salat, after I beckoned to do so?\" He said, \"It was not becoming for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead Salat in the presence of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)\".<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

        "hadithText": "Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary), the second one was the companion of Juraij who was a pious person. Juraij took a secluded monastery for worship and confined himself in it. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she called: 'Juraij.' He said: 'My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer.' He continued with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was (still) busy in prayer. She called: 'Juraij.' And he said: 'My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer,' and she returned. Then on the next day she again came while he was busy in prayer and called: 'Juraij.' And he said: 'My Rubb, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in my prayer.' And he continued with the prayer. She said: 'My Rubb, don't let him die until he has seen the faces of the prostitutes.' The story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer spread amongst Banu Israel. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty personified. She said (to the people): 'If you like, I can lure him to evil.' She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him. He (the shepherd) had sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant. When she gave birth to a baby she said: 'This is from Juraij.' So they came and asked Juraij to get down and demolished the temple and began to beat him. He asked them what the matter was. They said: 'You have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a baby from you.' He said: 'Where is the baby?' They brought him (the baby) and then he said: 'Just leave me so that I should perform prayer.' He performed prayer and when he finished, he lifted the baby in his stomach and asked him: 'O boy, who is your father?' The baby answered: 'He is such and such a shepherd.' So, the people turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking blessing) and said: 'We are prepared to construct your temple with gold.' He said, 'No just, rebuild it with mud as it had been,' and so they did\". (The Prophet (ﷺ) continued:) \"Then there was a baby who was sucking at his mother's breast when a person dressed in fine garment came on a priceless riding animal's back. His mother said: 'O Allah, make my child like this one.' He (the babe) left sucking and looked at him, and said: 'O Allah, don't make me like him.' He then returned to the breast and resumed sucking.\" He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: As though I can see Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as he is illustrating the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)) further reported Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying, \"There happened to pass by them a slave girl who was being beaten and they were saying: 'You have committed fornication and theft.' She was saying: 'Allah is enough for me and He is my Good Protector, and his mother said: 'O Allah, don't make my child like her.' He left sucking looked at her and said: 'O Allah! Make me like her.' It was followed by a conversation between the mother and the child. She said: 'A good looking man happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and there passed a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and theft, and I said: O Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her.' The child said: 'That man was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah don't make me like him; and they were saying about the girl: You committed fornication, whereas in fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft, whereas she had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her\".<br><br><b>[Al- Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

Zaid, you have indeed earned great merits. Could you narrate to us what you heard from Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?\" Zaid said, \"By Allah! I have grown old and have almost spent up my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so accept what I narrate to you, do not compel me to narrate what I fail to narrate\". He then said, \"One day Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up to deliver a Khutbah at a watering place known as Khumm between Makkah and Al-Madinah. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and exhorted (us) and said, 'Amma Ba'du. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Rubb and I will respond to Allah's Call, but I am leaving with you two weighty things: the first is the Book of Allah, in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it.' He exhorted (us to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said, 'The second is the members of my household, I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family. I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family. Husain said to Zaid, \"Who are the members of his household, O Zaid? Aren't his wives the members of his family?\" Thereupon Zaid said, \"His wives are the members of his family. (But here) the members of his family are those for whom Zakat is forbidden\". He asked, \"Who are they?\" Zaid said, \"Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas.\" Husain asked, \"For all of them the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden?\" Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Yes\".<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br>Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"I am leaving behind me two weighty things.

He 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Is your mother still alive?\" He said, \"Yes\". He 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"I heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying, 'There would come to you Owais bin 'Amir with the reinforcement from the people of Yemen. He would be from Qaran (the branch) of Murad. He had been suffering from leucoderma from which he was cured but for a spot of a dirham. He has a mother to whom he is very dutiful. If he were to take an oath in the Name of Allah, Allah would fulfill his oath. And if it is possible for you, ask him to ask forgiveness for you.' So, ask forgiveness for me\". He Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) did so. 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) then said, \"Where do you intend to go?\" He said, \"To Kufah.\" He 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Let me write a letter for you to its governor,\" whereupon he Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) said, \"I love to live amongst the poor people\". The following year, a person from among the elite (of Kufah) performed Hajj and he met 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him). 'Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) asked him about Owais (May Allah be pleased with him).

This man went to Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) and asked him to pray for forgiveness for him. Owais (May Allah be pleased with him) said to him, \"You have just returned from a blessed journey, it is you who should pray for forgiveness for me; and did you meet 'Umar?\" The man said, \"Yes\".

The two sides met (in combat) at one place. A man among the polytheists was so dashing that, whenever he intended to kill a man from Muslims, he killed him. Amongst the Muslims, too, was a man looking forward to (an opportunity of) his (polytheist's) unmindfulness. He (the narrator) said: We talked that he was Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him). When he raised his sword, he (the soldier of the polytheists) uttered: \"La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah).\" But he (Usamah bin Zaid) killed him. When the good news of victory reached Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) he asked him (about the events of the battle), and he informed him about the man (Usamah) and what he had done. He (Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)) sent for him and asked him why he had killed him. He (Usamah) said, \"O Messenger of Allah, he struck the Muslims and killed such and such of them.\" And he named some of them. (He continued): \"I attacked him and when he saw the sword he said: 'La ilaha illallah.\"' Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Did you kill him?\" He (Usamah) replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah then remarked, \"What would you do with regard to (the utterance): La ilaha illallah, when it comes (before you) on the Day of Resurrection?\" He (Usamah) said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Beg forgiveness for me\". He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said, \"What would you do with regard to (the utterance): La ilaha illallah, when it comes (before you) on the Day of Resurrection?\" He (Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)) added nothing to it but kept repeating, \"What would you do with regard to (the utterance): La ilaha illallah, when it comes (before you) on the Day of Resurrection?\".<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

Whenever it rained, it became difficult for me to cross it for going to their mosque. So I went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, \"I have weak eyesight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it. I wish you to come to my house and offer Salat at a place so that I could reserve that as a Musalla (place for prayer).\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"I will do so\". So Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) came to my house the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked my permission to enter and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, \"Where do you want us to offer Salat in your house?\" I pointed to the place where I wanted him to offer prayers. So Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rak'ah prayer and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called Khazirah which I had prepared for him. (Khazirah is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup). When the neighbours got the news that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in my house, they started coming till a large number of men gathered in my house. One of them said, \"What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?\" One of them replied, \"He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Messenger\". On that Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Don't say this. Haven't you seen that he testified that there is no true god except Allah,' for Allah's sake only.\" The man replied, \"Allah and His Messenger know better, but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied, \"No doubt, whosoever testifies that there is no true god except Allah, seeking by so professing the pleasure of Allah only, Allah will safeguard him against (Hell) Fire.\"<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

Then I heard of a man in Makkah who was preaching a message. So I mounted my camel and went to him. I found that (this man who was) Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained hidden because of the persecution by his people. I had entered Makkah stealthily and when I met him I asked him, \"Who are you?\" He (ﷺ) said, \"I am a Prophet.\" I asked; \"What is a Prophet?\" He said, \"Allah has sent me (with a message)\". I asked, \"With what has He sent you?\" He said, \"He sent me to strengthen the ties of kinship, to destroy idols so that Allah alone should be worshipped and nothing should be associated with Him\". I asked, \"Who has followed you in this?\" He said, \"A freeman and a slave\". (At that time only Abu Bakr and Bilal (May Allah be pleased with her) were with him). I said, \"I shall follow you\". He said, \"You can not do that now. Do you not see my situation and that of the people? Go to your people, and when you hear that my cause has prevailed, come to me\". So I went back to my people, and while I was with my people, Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) emigrated to Al-Madinah. I continued to ask people about him till some of my people visited Al- Madinah. On their return, I asked them, \"How is that man who has arrived in Al-Madinah faring?\" They said, \"People are hastening to him. His own people had planned to kill him but did not succeed.\" Then I went to Al-Madinah and came to him and said, \"O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?\" He (ﷺ) said, \"Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah.\" I said, \"O Messenger of Allah, tell me of that which Allah has taught you and of which I am unaware. Tell me about Salat first.\" He (ﷺ) replied, \"Perform the Fajr (morning) Salat, then stop Salat until the sun has risen up to the height of a lance, for when it rises, it rises up between the horns of the devil, and the infidels prostrate themselves before it at that time. Then perform Salat, for Salat is witnessed and angels attend it, until the shadow becomes equal to the length of its object; then stop Salat, for at that time Jahannam (Hell) is heated up. Then pray when the shadow becomes longer, for the prayer is witnessed and angels attend it, until you perform 'Asr prayer; then stop Salat till sun sets, for it sets between the horns of a devil. At that time the infidels prostrate themselves before it.\" I then asked the Messenger of Allah to tell me about Wudu', and he (ﷺ) said, \"When a person begins the Wudu' and washes his mouth and nose, the sins committed by his face, mouth and nostrils are washed out. Then when he washes his face as commanded by Allah, the sins of his face are washed out with the water from the sides of his beard. Then when he washes his hands up to elbows, the sins of his hands are washed out through his fingers with water. Then he passes his wet hands over his head and the sins of the head are washed out through the ends of his hair with water. Then he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet are washed out through his toes with water. Then, if he stands up for Salat and praises Allah, glorifies Him, proclaims His Greatness as He deserves and devotes his heart wholly to Allah, he emerges sin free as the day he was born\".<br><br>When 'Amr bin 'Abasah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated this Hadith to Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) a Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ), the latter said to him, \"Watch what you are saying. O 'Amr bin 'Abasah, a man will be getting all of this in one shot?\" 'Amr (May Allah be pleased with him) replied, \"O Abu Umamah, I have attained old age, my bones have become dry, my death is approaching and there is no need for me to tell lies concerning Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ). Had I not heard this from the Messenger of Allah only once, twice, thrice (and he counted up to seven) I would never have reported it.

Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"O Abu Dharr!\" I said, \"O Messenger of Allah, here I am responding to you\". He said, \"If I had as much gold as the weight of Uhud, it would not please me to have a single dinar out of it with me after the passage of three days, but I would hold back something for the repayment of a debt. I would distribute it among the slaves of Allah like this and like this and like this.\" And he (ﷺ) pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. We then walked a little further and he (ﷺ) said: \"The rich would be poor on the Day of Resurrection, except he who spent like this and like this and like this,\". and he pointed as he did the first time. \"But such persons are few\". Then he said, \"Stay where you are till I come back to you\". He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) walked ahead a little further in the darkness of the night and disappeared from my sight. I heard a loud voice. I said (to myself): \"The Messenger of Allah might have met (mishap or an enemy)\". I wished I could go after him but I remembered his commanding me to stay till he came back. So I waited for him; and when he came, I made mention of what I had heard. He asked, \"Did you hear it?\". I said, \"Yes\". Then he said, \"It was Jibril (Gabriel), who came to me and said: 'He who dies among your Ummah without having associated anything with Allah (in worship) will enter Jannah.'

He praised Allah, glorified Him, then said: \"Amma b'adu, verily, the world has been given the news of its end and is running to meet its end swiftly. Nothing is left out of it but a very little amount. Similar to the remainder in a dish whose owner is collecting it to drink; and you are going to move to an abode which knows no end, and you should proceed there with the good before you, for we have been informed (by the Prophet (ﷺ)) that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would travel down for seventy years but would not reach its bottom. By Allah, it will be filled (with men and jinn). Do you find it strange? We have been informed (i.e., by the Prophet (ﷺ)) that the distance between two shutters of the gate of Jannah is forty years (distance). And a day would come when it would be fully packed; I was the seventh amongst the seven who had been with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the sides of our mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore into two and divided between myself and Sa'd bin Malik. I made the lower garment with half of it and so did Sa'd. Today, there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city, and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great while I am insignificant to Allah.\"<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

One day, I was sitting on the way they usually take when the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me. When he saw me he smiled at me and knew my condition and my feelings. He called me and I replied, \"At your service, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said, \"Follow me.\" So I followed him. Having arrived at home, he sought permission and entered. He allowed me in and I, too, entered. He found milk in a bowl and asked, \"Where is this from?\" He was told that it was a gift for him from so- and-so. He called me and I responded: \"At your service, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said, \"Go to the people of As-Suffah and usher them in.\" He Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) explained: The people of As-Suffah were guests of Islam; they had no family, no property and no relations. When Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to receive something in charity, he would send it to them without taking anything from it. When he received a present, he would send for them and share it with them. On this occasion, I disliked to give them anything. I said to myself: \"This meagre quantity of milk will not be enough for all the people of As-Suffah! I am more deserving of it than anyone else. By drinking it I may attain some strength. When they come, he will order me to give it to them. I do not expect that anything will be left for me from this milk.\" As there was no alternative but to obey Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ). I went and called them. They came and sought permission which was granted. They took their seats. The Prophet (ﷺ) called me and I responded, \"At your service, O Messenger of Allah.\" He then said, \"Take the milk and give it to them.\" I took the bowl and gave it to one man who drank his fill and returned it to me, and I gave it to the next and he did the same. I went on doing this till the bowl reached Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). By that time all had taken their fill. He (ﷺ) took the bowl, put it on his hand, looked at me, smiled and said, \"Abu Hirr.\" I said, \"At your service, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said, \"Now you and I are left.\" I said, \"That is true, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said, \"Sit down and drink.\" I drank, but he went on saying, \"Drink some more.\" I said, \"By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have no room for it.\" He said, \"Then give it to me.\" So I gave him the bowl. He praised Allah, uttered the Name of Allah and drank the remainder.<br><br><b>[Al- Bukhari]</b>.<br><br></b>",

He provided us with a bag of dates, apart from which he found nothing for us. Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) gave each of us one date (every day). He (the narrator) was asked: \"What did you do with that?\" He said: We sucked that just like a baby and then drank water over that, and it was sufficient for us for the day until night. We beat off leaves with the help of our sticks, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then went to the seaside, when there appeared before us something like a big mound. We came near it and we found that it was a beast called Al-Anbar. Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: \"It is dead (so it useless for us).\" He then said: \"No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the way of Allah and you are hard-pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you can eat that.\" We, three hundred in number, stayed there for a month until we fattened up (having plenty to eat of that fish). He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or almost like a bull. Abu 'Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) called thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he held one of its ribs and raised it erect and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had with us and it passed through it (the arched rib), and we carried large pieces of meat for use in our journey. When we came back to Al-Madinah we went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him about that, whereupon he said, \"That was a sustenance Allah had brought forth for you. Do you have any piece of meat left with you, for us to eat.\" Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We sent to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) some of that (meat) and he ate it.<br><br><b>[Muslim]</b>.<br><br></b>",

The Companions went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him about it. He said, \"I will go down the trench to see it.\" He stood up and it was noticed that he had tied a stone over his stomach due to intense hunger. We had not tasted anything for three days. He took up a spade and struck the hard rock with it and it turned into sand. I sought his permission to go home, (after reaching home I) said to my wife, \"I have seen the Prophet (ﷺ) in a state that I am unable to endure. Have you got anything in the house?\" She said, \"I have a small quantity of barley and a lamb.\" I slaughtered the lamb, ground the barley and put the meat in the cooking pot. Then I went to the Prophet (ﷺ). In the meantime the flour had been kneaded and the meat in the pot was nearly cooked. I said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah, I have some food, will you come along with one or two Companions?\" He asked, \"How many men should go there?\" I told him the number. He said, \"It will be better if they are more in number. Tell your wife not to remove the pot from the hearth nor the bread from the oven till I arrive.\" Then he said to the Muhajirun and the Ansar: \"Let us go (to eat).\" They all rose (and went with him). I went to my wife and said, \"Bless you, the Prophet (ﷺ), the Muhajirun, the Ansar and the whole company are coming.\" She said, \"Did he (ﷺ) ask you?\" I replied in the affirmative. (When they arrived) Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to his Companions, \"Enter, but do not crowd in.\" Then he started breaking up the bread and putting meat on it. He would take from the pot and the oven then would cover them up, approach his Companions and hand it over to them. He would then go back and uncover the pot and the oven. He continued to break up the bread and put meat on it till all had eaten to their fill and still some of the food remained. Then he said to my wife, \"Eat from it, and send it as a present, for the people have been afflicted with severe hunger.\"<br><br><b>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</b>.<br><br>Another narration is: Jabir said: When the trench was being dug, I noticed the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet (ﷺ). I returned to my wife and said to her, \"Have you got anything in the house? I have seen the signs of severe hunger on the face of Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).\" She brought out a bag which contained a Sa' (a measure that equals approximately 3kg.) of barley. We had a lamb which was reared in the home. I slaughtered the lamb and she ground the flour for baking bread. I then cut the meat and put it in the cooking pot. When I was returning to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), my wife said to me, \"Do not embarass me before Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his Companions.\" (She said this because she thought that the food would not be enough for everyone, for how can very little food cater for a thousand people?) When I came to him, I said to him in a low tone, \"O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we have slaughtered a small lamb and have ground a Sa' of barley. Please accompany me with a few of your Companions.\" Thereupon he (ﷺ) announced in a loud voice, \"O people of the Trench, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so all of you are welcome.\" And addressing me he said, \"Do not take the pot off the fire, nor bake the kneaded flour till I arrive.\" So I came home and he came ahead of the people. My wife said, \"It will be a matter of disgrace for you (because there is not enough food).\" I said, \"I did only what you told me.\" She brought out the kneaded flour and Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spat into it, and invoked the blessing of Allah on it, and then he spat into the cooking pot and invoked the blessing of Allah on it. Then he said, \"Call another woman to help bake bread and let her take out from the cooking pot, but do not take it off the fire.\" There were about a thousand guests. All of them ate till they left the food and went off. Our pot still bubbled as before and the dough was being baked as before.<br><br></b>",

Have you got any food?\" She said, \"Yes.\" So she brought out barley loaves, took off her head covering, in a part of which she wrapped these loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it.

I stood near them whereupon Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked, \"Has Abu Talhah sent you?\" I said, \"Yes.\" Thereupon he said to those who were with him to get up (and follow him). He went forth and so did I, ahead of them until I came to Abu Talhah and informed him. Abu Talhah said, \"O Umm Sulaim, here comes Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) along with the people and we do not have enough (food) to feed them.\" She said, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" Abu Talhah went out (to receive him) until he met Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he came forward along with him until they both (Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) came in. Then Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"O Umm Sulaim, bring forth what you have with you.\" So she brought the bread. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded that the bread be broken into small pieces and after Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) had squeezed clarified butter out of a butter container and made it just like soup. Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited over it what Allah wished him to recite. He then said, \"Allow ten guests to come in.\" They ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)) again said, \"Allow ten (more to come in)\", and he (the host) ushered them in. They ate to their fill. Then they went out. He (ﷺ) again said, \"Allow ten (more),\" until all the people ate to their fill.

I asked one of his Companions about the reason of it and he said that it was on account of severe hunger.\" Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) went to my mother and asked, \"Have you got anything?\" She said, \"Yes. I have a piece of bread and some dry dates.

I saw in it Jibril (Gabriel) (ﷺ) who called me and said: 'Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, heard what your people said to you and the response they made to you. And He has sent you the angel in charge of the mountains to order him to do to them what you wish.' Then the angel of the mountains called me, greeted me and said: 'O Muhammad, Allah listened to what your people had said to you. I am the angel of the mountains, and my Rubb has sent me to you so that you may give me your orders. (I will carry out your orders).

As for this Ummah, it will have sound state and in its early stage of existence; but the last phase of its existence, will be faced with trials and with things you do not recognize. There will be tremendous trials, one after the other, and to each the believer will say, 'That is it'. Whenever a trial arrives the believer will say: 'This is going to bring about my destruction.' When this passes, another calamity will approach and he will say: 'This surely is going to be my end.' Whosoever wishes to be removed from the Fire (Hell) and admitted to Jannah should die with faith in Allah and the Last Day; and he should treat others as he wishes to be treated. He who swears allegiance to an Imam, he should give him the pledge in ratification and the sincerity of his heart. He should obey him to the best of his capacity.

I am not the one to do that, go to my son Ibrahim (Abraham), the beloved man of Allah.' Then Ibrahim (ﷺ) when approached, will say: `I am not the one to do that, for I was only a friend; and that is not a lofty status but ask Musa (Moses) to whom Allah spoke.' They will then go to Musa (ﷺ) but he will say: `I am not the one to do that; go to `Isa (Jesus), Allah's Word and spirit.' `Isa (ﷺ) will say: `I am not the one to do that.' So they will come to me; and I will stand and be given permission. Amanah and ties of relationship will be sent forth and will stand on the sides of the Sirat (that is, the Bridge set over Hell-fire) right and left, and the first of you will pass like lightning.'' I said (that is Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)\" :I ransom you with my father and mother, what is like the movement of lightning?'' The Messenger of Allah replied, \"Have you not seen how the lightning goes and returns in the twinkling of an eye? Next (group will pass) like the passing of the breeze, next like the passing of a bird, and the next with the speed of a running man, according to the quality of their deeds.

On both sides of the Bridge pronged flesh hooks, placed under command will be hung and will seize those about whom they receive command, some people being lacerated and escaping and others being thrown violently into Hell.''
